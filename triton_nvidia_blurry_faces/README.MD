## Blurry faces: Training, Optimizing and Deploying a segmentation model on Amazon SageMaker with NVIDIA TensorRT and NVIDIA Triton

***
### Important note
I had to remove all the model files as the repo was getting too big to handle even with `git-lfs`
***

This directory contains all the work I have done on training, optimizing and deploying a blurry-faces segmentation model on Amazon SageMaker with NVIDIA TensorRT and NVIDIA Triton.
