# Playground
This repo contains ML/DL projects in the form of standalone notebooks or more complex directories.

It started as a way to play around with various Kaggle's datasets (hence the name `KagglePlaygrounds`) with the goal to learn new Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks/techniques.

I recently started adding new non-Kaggle-related-exclusive content, sharing work around various Deep Learning experiments especially on AWS.

Check out my [ML blog](https://francescopochetti.com/) for posts about each one of those.

**Note**: a couple of projects might need `git lfs` installed and setup.
