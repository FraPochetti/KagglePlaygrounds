# Playground
This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks I create to play around with various Kaggle's datasets of interest with the goal to learn new Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks/techniques.
I recently started adding new non-Kaggle-related-exclusive content, sharing some notebooks with various Deep Learning experiments especially around the fastai library.

Check out my (ML blog)[https://francescopochetti.com/] for posts about each one of those kernels.
