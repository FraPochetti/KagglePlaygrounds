 Hoysala literature is the large body of literature in the Kannada and Sanskrit languages produced by the Hoysala Empire ( <unk> – <unk> ) in what is now southern India . The empire was established by <unk> Kama II , came into political prominence during the rule of King Vishnuvardhana ( 1108 – <unk> ) , and declined gradually after its defeat by the <unk> dynasty invaders in <unk> . 
 Kannada literature during this period consisted of writings relating to the socio @-@ religious developments of the Jain and Veerashaiva faiths , and to a lesser extent that of the Vaishnava faith . The earliest well @-@ known brahmin writers in Kannada were from the Hoysala court . While most of the courtly textual production was in Kannada , an important corpus of monastic Vaishnava literature relating to Dvaita ( <unk> ) philosophy was written by the renowned philosopher Madhvacharya in Sanskrit . 
 Writing Kannada literature in native metres was first popularised by the court poets . These metres were the sangatya , compositions sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument ; shatpadi , six @-@ line verses ; ragale , lyrical compositions in blank verse ; and tripadi , three @-@ line verses . However , Jain writers continued to use the traditional champu , composed of prose and verse .
