 The film announced in November 2009 . It was directed by <unk> Bramantyo , a Yogyakarta @-@ born Muslim filmmaker . Bramantyo , who had previously directed the Islamic @-@ themed <unk> @-@ <unk> Cinta ( The <unk> of Love ; 2008 ) , considered Dahlan his favourite national hero ; he later told The Jakarta Post that he admired the <unk> 's spirit . He also said that he had been wanting to make the film since he was a teenager . The film was meant to coincide with the 100 year anniversary of Muhammadiyah 's founding . 
 Bramantyo attempted to make his film as historically accurate as possible . However , as no documentation of Dahlan 's life before he went to Mecca exists , the scenes showing Dahlan 's youth were fictionalized . The script underwent 12 revisions before the film was completed . Much of the film 's budget of <unk> . 12 billion ( US $ 1 @.@ 3 million ) was spent on costumes and sets to ensure accuracy .
