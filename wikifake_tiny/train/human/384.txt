In high school during the 1960s he explored his sexuality at underground gay teen nightclubs , while living in fear that his abusive father would find out .

 Baker began taking drugs , and became , in his own words , " an out of control , teenage speed freak " . He also began drinking heavily , attributing it to the fact that he was <unk> . However , even after coming out , his substance abuse remained excessive and " still had a life of its own " . After sobering up , he attended UCLA film school , where he was one of the winners of the Samuel Goldwyn Writing Awards , and directed two films : Mouse <unk> <unk> and Blonde Death .
