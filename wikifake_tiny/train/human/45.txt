 Papa <unk> is located at the south western end of St Magnus Bay .

To the west the island is <unk> by a belt of glacial <unk> about one and a half kilometres in length . Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow <unk> soil that may be derived from glacial till . There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile . The lack of peat led to ' turf <unk> ' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior .
