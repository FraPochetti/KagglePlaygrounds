 Asahi ( <unk> , Asahi ) was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( <unk> ) in the late 1890s . As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself , the ship was designed and built in the United Kingdom . Shortly after her arrival in Japan , she became flagship of the Standing Fleet , the <unk> 's primary combat fleet . She participated in every major naval battle of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 â€“ 05 and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of <unk> . Asahi saw no combat during World War I , although the ship participated in the Siberian Intervention in 1918 . 
 <unk> as a coastal defence ship in 1921 , Asahi was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty , after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship . She was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in 1928 . Asahi was recommissioned in late 1937 , after the start of the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , and used to transport Japanese troops . In 1938 , she was converted into a repair ship and based first at Japanese @-@ occupied Shanghai , China , and then Cam <unk> Bay , French Indochina , from late 1938 to 1941 . The ship was transferred to occupied Singapore in early 1942 to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in May . She was sunk en route by the American submarine USS Salmon , although most of her crew survived .
