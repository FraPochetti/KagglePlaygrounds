 The High Five Interchange is one of the first five @-@ level stack interchanges built in Dallas , Texas . Located at the junction of the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ( Interstate 635 , I @-@ 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US Highway 75 , US 75 ) , it replaces an <unk> partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the 1960s . 
 The $ 261 million project was started in 2002 and completed in December 2005 . It was designed by the <unk> Corporation and built by <unk> Construction Corporation . 
 The interchange is considered by Popular <unk> to be one of " The World 's 18 <unk> <unk> " because of its height ( as high as a 12 @-@ story building ) , its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features . In 2006 , the American Public Works Association named the High Five Interchange as " Public Works <unk> of the Year " .

 The High Five Interchange , north of downtown in Dallas , Texas , is a massive five @-@ level freeway interchange . It is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ( Interstate 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US 75 ) , and is the first five @-@ level stack interchange to be built in the city . 
 It replaces the <unk> three @-@ level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing US 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways . The looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic . Left @-@ hand exits contributed to the congestion . Further , its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult . 
 <unk> to the celebratory gesture , the " High Five " name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower over the landscape . The interchange is as high as a 12 @-@ story building , and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels ( the " High Five " ) , 710 support tiers , and 60 miles of additional highway . The highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground . The lanes of US 75 , which are on the bottom level , are 20 feet ( 6 m ) below ground level , giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top As part of the project , I @-@ 635 was widened to include four dedicated high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes ( <unk> lanes ) that are barrier @-@ separated and <unk> . 
 The roads on the five levels are : 
 Level I : US 75 , an eight lane highway , four lanes going each way 
 Level II : The junction of the two six @-@ lane frontage roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left @-@ turn lanes and <unk> , and easy access to US 75 and I @-@ 635 
 Level III : I @-@ 635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four <unk> lanes ( two going each way ) separated by barriers 
 Level IV and V : Direct connection ramps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf 
 The interchange , with its decorative <unk> on <unk> concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation ( <unk> ) , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art . The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the <unk> Trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange . The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by <unk> .
