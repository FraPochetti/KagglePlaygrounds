 " Back Off <unk> " is a song by English musician <unk> Starr , released as a non @-@ album single in March 1972 . Starr 's former Beatles <unk> George Harrison produced the recording , which took place in London shortly after the two had appeared together at Harrison 's Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971 . The single was a follow @-@ up to Starr 's 1971 hit song " It Don 't Come Easy " and continued his successful run as a solo artist . " Back Off <unk> " peaked at number 2 in Britain and Canada , and number 9 on America 's Billboard Hot 100 . It remains Starr 's highest @-@ charting single in the United Kingdom . 
 The title for the song was inspired by English singer @-@ songwriter Marc <unk> . Some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney , reflecting Starr 's disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years . " Back Off <unk> " demonstrates the influence of <unk> rock on Starr , who directed a documentary film , Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , about <unk> 's band T. Rex around this time . Described by one author as a " high @-@ energy in @-@ your @-@ face rocker " , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus <unk> . 
 Starr re @-@ recorded " Back Off <unk> " for his 1981 album Stop and <unk> the Roses , in a collaboration with American singer Harry Nilsson that incorporates lyrics from Beatles songs such as " With a Little Help from My Friends " , " Good Day Sunshine " and " Baby , You 're a Rich Man " . The original version has appeared on Starr 's compilation albums <unk> from Your Past and <unk> : The Very Best of <unk> Starr , and as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio album <unk> Vienna . Since his return to touring in 1989 , Starr has performed " Back Off <unk> " regularly in concert with the various <unk> of his All @-@ Starr Band .

 <unk> Starr identified his initial inspiration for " Back Off <unk> " as having come from Marc <unk> , the singer and guitarist with English <unk> rock band T. Rex . In a 2001 interview with <unk> editor Paul Du <unk> , Starr described <unk> as " a dear friend who used to come into the office when I was running Apple Movies , a big office in town , and the hang @-@ out for myself , Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon " . Over dinner one evening at Starr 's home outside London , <unk> had used the word " <unk> " so often that it stuck in Starr 's mind , after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight . When discussing the composition on VH1 <unk> in May 1998 , Starr explained : " [ <unk> ] was an <unk> guy . He used to speak : ' Back off <unk> ... <unk> you , <unk> . ' ' Do you want some potatoes ? ' ' <unk> you , <unk> ! ' " Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children 's toys that night , in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song . 
 The lyrics to the middle eight of " Back Off <unk> " came to Starr while watching London Weekend Television 's football show , The Big Match . The program 's host , Jimmy Hill , often referred to a footballer 's playing as " <unk> " , a catchphrase that Starr incorporated into his song lyrics : 
 Get yourself together now 
 And give me something <unk> 
 Everything you try to do 
 You know it sure sounds wasted . 
 Commentators have interpreted the song , and particularly this statement , as an attack by Starr on his former Beatles <unk> Paul McCartney . Starr has denied any such interpretation , instead " claiming that the song was inspired by <unk> and nothing more " , Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez writes . Starr had publicly criticised McCartney 's solo albums McCartney ( 1970 ) and Ram ( 1971 ) on release , and author Bruce <unk> <unk> the message of the middle eight as " a plea for Paul to produce better music " . The mention of " sound [ ing ] wasted " could also be a reference to McCartney 's <unk> with cannabis , Rodriguez suggests . A further example of Starr 's allegedly anti @-@ McCartney message exists in the song 's first verse : 
 Wake up , <unk> 
 Don 't pretend that you are dead 
 Get yourself up off the cart .
