 Mount <unk> is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the highest point in the U.S. state of Colorado and the entire Mississippi River drainage basin . The ultra @-@ prominent 14 @,@ 440 @-@ foot ( <unk> @.@ 2 m ) <unk> is the highest peak in the <unk> Range and the second @-@ highest summit in the contiguous United States after Mount Whitney . Mount <unk> is located in San Isabel National Forest , 12 @.@ 1 miles ( 19 @.@ 4 km ) southwest ( bearing 223 Â° ) of the City of <unk> in Lake County , Colorado . 
 The mountain was named in honor of Colorado statesman Samuel <unk> <unk> , who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from 1873 to 1874 . Henry W. <unk> of the <unk> Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak , in 1874 . The <unk> and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A + in <unk> <unk> . Mount <unk> is therefore often referred to as the " gentle giant " that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains .

 Mount <unk> is visible to the southwest of <unk> , often snow @-@ capped even in the summer . Many other <unk> surround <unk> in all directions , and it is very close to central Colorado 's Collegiate <unk> . The neighboring Mount Massive , to the north , is the second @-@ highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third @-@ highest in the contiguous United States , and La Plata Peak , to the south , is the fifth @-@ highest in the Rockies . The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount <unk> , Denver is about 130 miles ( <unk> km ) to the east , <unk> is 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the north , and <unk> is 40 miles ( 64 km ) to the west . <unk> , about 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the northeast , is the nearest large town . <unk> 's parent peak is Mount Whitney in California . Including Alaska and Hawaii , Mount <unk> is the fourteenth @-@ highest mountain in the United States . 
 Weather conditions often change rapidly , and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the <unk> ; <unk> and snow are possible year @-@ round . An electrical storm on the mountain 's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of Science .

 Mount <unk> is part of the <unk> Range , an <unk> of the Laramide <unk> which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago . The tops of this range were heavily <unk> , leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues . For example , the base of <unk> on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and <unk> rocks deposited when the glaciers <unk> , which lie on a lateral <unk> . Further up the eastern side there is a large <unk> with a small <unk> . There are also lakes to both the north and south , <unk> and Twin Lakes respectively ; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines , and <unk> Lake was created by the <unk> Sugar <unk> Dam . 
 Mount <unk> is composed largely of <unk> . However , the summit ridge consists of <unk> basement rock , which is Pre @-@ <unk> in origin and about 1 @.@ 7 billion years old . There are various igneous <unk> including <unk> , as well as " bands " of <unk> and <unk> . Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere , <unk> lacks both a permanent <unk> and a prominent north @-@ facing <unk> , which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height , causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation .

 Mount <unk> was named by miners in honor of Samuel <unk> <unk> , the governor of the then @-@ Territory of Colorado , because he brokered a treaty in September 1873 with the <unk> tribe that opened up more than 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) of reservation land to mining and railroad activity . The first recorded ascent of the peak was by <unk> <unk> in 1874 , who was surveying the mountain as part of the <unk> Survey .
