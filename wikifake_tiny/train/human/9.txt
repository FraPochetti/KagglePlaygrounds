 The military history of Australia spans the nation 's 220 @-@ year modern history , from the early Australian frontier wars between <unk> and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 21st century . Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity , including the Anzac spirit . The relationship between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of Australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma . 
 As British <unk> , the Australian colonies participated in Britain 's small wars of the 19th century , while later as a <unk> dominion , and then an independent nation , Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War , as well as in the wars in Korea , Malaya , Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War . In the Post @-@ Vietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions , through the United Nations and other agencies , including in the Sinai , Persian Gulf , <unk> , Somalia , East Timor and the Solomon Islands , while more recently they have also fought as part of multi @-@ lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan . In total , nearly 103 @,@ 000 Australians died during the course of these conflicts .

 For most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males , and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century , it continues to influence Australian society to this day . War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history , while a major part of the national identity has been built on an <unk> conception of the Australian experience of war and of <unk> , known as the Anzac spirit . These ideals include notions of endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; traits which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War . The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity . 
 The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture : <unk> with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare . Indeed , Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942 , while since then an alliance with the United States has <unk> its security . <unk> , this pattern of <unk> — both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more <unk> security concerns — has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies . Regardless , a tendency towards strategic <unk> has also been evident , with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to <unk> resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which has historically resulted in <unk> for major military challenges . 
 Reflecting both the realist and liberal <unk> of international relations and the conception of national interests , a number of other important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious . Such themes include : an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics , the <unk> of notions of <unk> sovereignty , a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a <unk> of security , and the proposition that the status <unk> in international affairs should only be changed peacefully . Likewise , <unk> , collective security and defence self @-@ reliance have also been important themes . Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic <unk> have persisted throughout its history , being the product of Australian society 's democratic political tradition and <unk> @-@ Christian Anglo @-@ European heritage , as well its associated values , beliefs and economic , political and religious ideology . These <unk> are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia @-@ Pacific , and the <unk> circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power . To be sure , during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved in foreign wars . Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers — known colloquially as <unk> — have often been noted , somewhat <unk> , for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities .
