 In 1842 , Fort Scott was named after Winfield Scott , was established on the American frontier on the military road in eastern Kansas between Fort <unk> and Fort Gibson . It was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers , who were migrating from the Eastern United States . Fort Scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the Plains Indians , as well as to protect the Indians from the settlers ' encroachment . 
 The United States government intention to reserve permanent Indian lands west of the Missouri River gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to <unk> on the Indian settlements . Fort Scott 's most active days were between 1842 and 1853 , although it was also used during the Civil War .

 The <unk> of Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) were upset to have Fort Wayne in their proximity . After some delay , the US Army decided to abandon Fort Wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between Fort <unk> and the site . The Army both wanted to <unk> the <unk> ( who were supervised by the Department of Defense ) and provide more defense for white settlers and other Indians against the Osage , who had been conducting frequent raids in the area . On April 1 , 1842 , some soldiers of Fort Wayne left their fort and on April 22 arrived where Fort Scott would be built , in the Osage <unk> section of modern @-@ day Kansas . After <unk> with the <unk> to acquire the land , the rest of Fort Wayne 's garrison left the fort on May 26 and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May 30 . 
 Unlike most forts for military use , the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built ; the wide @-@ open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary . The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men , animals , and equipment . These buildings were on the edges of a 350 @-@ foot ( 110 m ) parade ground . 
 The post <unk> , Captain Thomas Swords , was in charge of building Fort Scott 's structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie , which had few trees . He had only two <unk> and three carpenters to rely on , as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform . Wood was available , but the mill was built 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away , making transport time consuming . Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood , skilled labor and working equipment . Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort 's construction . As a result , only one <unk> of the five planned officers quarters ( four <unk> and post commandant 's house ) was built by 1844 , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed . In his 1844 inspection of the fort , Colonel George <unk> reported that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered Fort Scott " above average " . 
 Due to the rising tensions that escalated in the Mexican @-@ American War , the US Army redeployed troops to the Southwest . With Fort Scott still uncompleted , officials decided on April 25 , 1850 , that no more construction would be done there , after eight years and $ 35 @,@ 000 . By the time it was finished , it was obsolete ; three years later , it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western Fort Riley . 
 For the average soldier , life at the fort was " <unk> " . Until the permanent structures were built , soldiers had to live in tents , which lacked comfort . Aside from a few whiskey <unk> and prostitutes , few civilians lived at the fort . Officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including Captain Swords . Five miles East in Missouri was a <unk> shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts @-@ martial followed soldiers ' going <unk> at the shop .
