 In the 1890s , the lighthouse was first formally proposed to mark the Norwalk Harbor . In 1899 , the United States Congress appropriated $ 60 @,@ 000 for the establishment of a light and fog signal at Greens Ledge . In 1900 , the Philadelphia Construction Company was contracted to construct the foundation and the superstructure . The design for this type of lighthouse was first realized in 1873 , from Major <unk> of the Lighthouse Board . The foundation form is made of identical curved @-@ iron plates with top inward @-@ pointing <unk> that are <unk> together and secured with knees . The assembled rings are lowered into the water and filled with concrete or stone , concrete for the Greens Ledge Light . A series of photographs from the work in 1901 shows the assembly of the three lower courses at Wilson 's Point , the lowering of the cylinder and the light in the fall of 1901 prior to a deposit of protective <unk> . 
 The 52 @-@ foot ( 16 m ) tall Greens Ledge Light was completed in 1902 and serves as a typical example of a <unk> lighthouse . Located in 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) of water , the foundation flares out to support the deck the lighthouse is built on and includes a cavity for the lighthouse 's brick basement and cisterns . The four @-@ story structure of the lighthouse is assembled from five courses of curved iron plates . The interior is lined with brick to <unk> and strengthen the tower and to " <unk> [ e ] an anchorage for the winding cast @-@ iron stairs which rise on the periphery of each story , " writes historian Dorothy <unk> . 
 The plain prefabricated features underwent a period of development of which the Greens Ledge Light was part of a second phase . <unk> describes , " the brackets which support the <unk> gallery and covered deck [ as having ] a simplified classical detailing and [ the ] rectilinear window <unk> are enclosed in shallower , <unk> cast @-@ iron surrounds . " A deck <unk> the light on above the first story , the <unk> and lantern . The original roofing and some cast @-@ iron <unk> of the decks are able to be seen atop the <unk> . The cast @-@ iron door to the lighthouse faces south and at the time of nomination the windows were sealed with <unk> . The first floor of the lighthouse serves as the kitchen . The second level has two rooms split by a partition with the smaller room being a bathroom . The third level was not divided , but did not have a description in the National Historic Register of Places survey . The fourth floor has six <unk> windows and has had much of its woodwork removed and part of the cast @-@ iron floor and brick wall are exposed . The lighthouse 's lantern measures 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) in diameter . Once active , the Sheffield Island Light was discontinued .

The light continues to serve as an active aid to navigation . In 1987 , a FA @-@ 251 was installed before the current lens , a <unk> @-@ 25 was installed . The current light characteristic is an alternating white and red flash every 24 seconds . The white and red flashes can be seen for 18 nautical miles and 15 nautical miles , <unk> .
