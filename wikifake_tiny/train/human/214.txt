 The architecture of the Song dynasty ( 960 â€“ 1279 ) was noted for its towering Buddhist pagodas , enormous stone and wooden bridges , lavish tombs , and extravagant palaces . Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand , architectural writing <unk> during the Song dynasty , <unk> into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a <unk> , organized manner . In addition to the examples still standing , depictions in Song artwork , architectural drawings , and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding the architecture of the period . 
 The professions of architect , master craftsman , carpenter , and structural engineer did not have the high status of the Confucian scholar @-@ officials during the dynastic era . Architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years , usually from craftsman fathers to their sons . There were also government agencies and schools for construction , building , and engineering . The Song dynasty 's building manuals aided not only the various private workshops , but also the craftsmen employed by the central government .

 The layout of ancient Chinese capitals , such as Bianjing , capital of the Northern Song , followed the guidelines in <unk> Gong Ji , which specified a square city wall with several gates on each side and passageways for the emperor . The outer city of ancient Bianjing was built during the reign of Emperor <unk> to a rectangular plan , almost square in proportions , about 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) from north to south and 7 km ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) from west to east . The south wall had three gates , with <unk> Gate in the center , <unk> Gate to the east , and <unk> Gate to the west . The other walls had four gates each : in the east wall were <unk> Gate ( at the southern end ) , <unk> Gate , <unk> Gate , and North @-@ East Water Gate ; in the west wall <unk> Gate , West Water Gate , <unk> Gate , and <unk> Gate ; and in the north wall <unk> Gate ( at the eastern end ) , <unk> Gate , New Wild <unk> Gate and <unk> Gate . The gates in the center of each of the four sides were reserved for the emperor ; these gates had straight passages and only two sets of doors , while the other city gates had <unk> passages and were guarded by three sets of doors . 
 The Song artist Zhang <unk> 's painting Along the River During the <unk> Festival depicts the <unk> Gate in detail : the building on top had a five @-@ <unk> roof with a shallow slope in the Song dynasty style , supported prominently by two sets of brackets ( dougong ) . The lower bracket assembly rested on the city gate to form a wooden foundation , while the upper assembly supported the roof , similar to the dougong in an extant Song building , the Goddess Temple in Taiyuan . This method of using bracket assemblies to support superstructure was specified in Li Jie 's 12th @-@ century building manual Yingzao Fashi as <unk> ( literally " flat base " ) . 
 The city wall itself was built with rammed earth , a technique also detailed in Yingzao Fashi , vol . III , " Standards for <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Work " : 
 Foundation : For every square chi , apply two dan of earth ; on top of it lay a mixture of broken brick , tile and crushed stones , also two dan . For every five @-@ cun layer of earth , two men , standing face to face , should tamp six times with <unk> , each man pounding three times on a dent ; then tamp four times on each dent , two men again standing face to face , each pounding twice on the same dent ; then tamp two more times , each man pounding once . Following this , tamp the surface with <unk> or stamp with feet randomly to even out the surface . Every five @-@ cun layer of earth should be compressed to three cun ; every three @-@ cun layer of brick and stone to one and a half cun . 
 <unk> @-@ earth walls during this time were tapered : the thickness of the wall is greatest at the base and decreases steadily with increasing height , as detailed in Li Jie 's book . 
 During the Song dynasty , the city of Bianjing had three enclosures : the outer city wall , the inner city wall , and the palace at the center . The inner city was rectangular , with three doors on each side . The palace enclosure was also rectangular , with a watch tower on each of the four corners .
