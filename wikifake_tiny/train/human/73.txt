 The Sorraia is a rare breed of horse indigenous to the portion of the Iberian peninsula , in the Sorraia River basin , in Portugal . The Sorraia is known for its primitive features , including a convex profile and dun coloring with primitive markings . Concerning its origins , a theory has been advanced by some authors that the Sorraia is a descendant of primitive horses belonging to the naturally occurring wild fauna of Southern Iberia . Studies are currently ongoing to discover the relationship between the Sorraia and various wild horse types , as well as its relationship with other breeds from the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Africa . 
 Members of the breed are small , but <unk> and well @-@ adapted to harsh conditions . They were occasionally captured and used by native farmers for centuries , and a remnant population of these nearly extinct horses was discovered by a Portuguese zoologist in the early 20th century . Today , the Sorraia has become the focus of preservation efforts , with European scientists leading the way and enthusiasts from several countries forming projects and establishing herds to assist in the re @-@ establishment of this breed from its current endangered status .

 The Sorraia breed stands between 14 @.@ 1 and 14 @.@ 3 hands ( 57 and 59 inches , 145 and 150 cm ) high , although some individuals are as small as 12 @.@ 3 hands ( 51 inches , 130 cm ) The head tends to be large , the profile convex , and the ears long . The neck is slender and long , the <unk> high , and the <unk> slightly sloping . The legs are strong , with long <unk> and well @-@ <unk> hooves . These horses have good endurance and are easy keepers , thriving on relatively little <unk> . They have a reputation for being independent of temperament , but <unk> . 
 On adult horses , the lay of the hair can create the appearance of stripes or " barring " on the neck and chest . Also due to the lay of the hair , newborn foals can appear to have stripes all over , reminiscent of zebra stripes . The breed standard refers to this as " hair stroke " .

 Sorraia are generally dun or a dun variation called <unk> . Dun coloring includes primitive markings such as a black dorsal stripe , black tipped ears , horizontal <unk> on the legs and a dark muzzle area . The dark muzzle area is in contrast to some other dun @-@ colored horse breeds , who have light @-@ colored muzzle areas and <unk> , possibly due to the presence of <unk> genetics . Sorraia horses have bi @-@ colored <unk> and tails with lighter colored hairs that fringe the outside of the longer growing black hair . This is a characteristic shared with other predominantly dun @-@ colored breeds , such as the <unk> horse . <unk> Sorraia occasionally have white markings , although they are rare and <unk> by the breed 's studbook .

 The relationship between the Sorraia and other breeds remains largely undetermined , as is its relationship to the wild horse subspecies , the Tarpan and the Przewalski 's Horse . The Sorraia originally developed in the southern part of the Iberian <unk> d 'Andrade hypothesized that the Sorraia would be the ancestor of the Southern Iberian breeds . <unk> , scientists place the Sorraia as closely related to the <unk> and the <unk> , but genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA show that the Sorraia forms a cluster that is largely separated from most Iberian breeds . Some evidence links this cluster with <unk> and domestic Mongolian horses . At the same time , one of the maternal lineages is shared with the <unk> . Genetic evidence has not supported an hypothesis that the Sorraia is related to the <unk> horse , an African breed introduced to Iberia by the Moors . 
 Multiple authors have suggested that the Sorraia might be a descendant of the Tarpan based on shared morphological features , principally the typical color of its coat .
