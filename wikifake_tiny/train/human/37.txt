 On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U.S. ) landed on <unk> , <unk> , and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands . The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia . They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul and support the Allied New Guinea campaign . The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long <unk> campaign . 
 Taking the Japanese by surprise , by nightfall on 8 August the Allied landing forces had secured <unk> and nearby small islands , as well as an airfield under construction at <unk> Point ( 9 ° 25 ′ 45 ″ S 160 ° 3 ′ 4 ″ E ) on the north shore of the island of <unk> east of the present day capital of <unk> . <unk> placed his 11 @,@ 000 troops of the 1st Marine Division on <unk> in a loose perimeter around the <unk> Point area . 
 On 12 August , the airfield was named Henderson Field after Major <unk> Henderson , a Marine <unk> who had been killed at the Battle of Midway . The Allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of Henderson Field were called the " <unk> Air Force " after the Allied code name for <unk> . 
 In response to the Allied landings on <unk> , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army 's 17th Army — a corps @-@ sized command based at Rabaul ( 4 ° 11 ′ 56 ″ S 152 ° 9 ′ 57 ″ E ) and under the command of Lieutenant @-@ General <unk> <unk> — with the task of retaking <unk> from Allied forces . The 17th Army — heavily involved with the Japanese campaign in New Guinea — had only a few units available to send to the southern <unk> area . Of these units , the 35th Infantry Brigade — under Major General <unk> <unk> — was at <unk> , the 4th ( <unk> ) Infantry Regiment was in the Philippines and the 28th ( <unk> ) Infantry Regiment — under the command of Colonel <unk> <unk> — was embarked on transport ships near Guam . The different units began to move toward <unk> immediately ; <unk> 's regiment — the closest — arrived first . The " First <unk> " of <unk> 's unit — consisting of about <unk> soldiers — landed from destroyers at <unk> Point ( 9 ° 24 ′ 38 ″ S 160 ° 20 ′ 56 ″ E ) , about 18 mi ( 29 km ) east of the <unk> perimeter , on August 19 .
