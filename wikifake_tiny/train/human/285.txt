 Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , also known as acute <unk> leukemia or acute <unk> leukemia ( <unk> ) , is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells , characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells . AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults , and its incidence increases with age . Although AML is a relatively rare disease , accounting for roughly 1 @.@ 2 % of cancer deaths in the United States , its incidence is expected to increase as the population ages . 
 The symptoms of AML are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells , which causes a drop in red blood cells , platelets , and normal white blood cells . These symptoms include fatigue , shortness of breath , easy bruising and bleeding , and increased risk of infection . Several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified , but the specific cause is not clear . As an acute leukemia , AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated . 
 AML has several subtypes ; treatment and prognosis vary among subtypes . AML is cured in 35 – 40 % of people less than 60 years old and 5 – 15 % more than 60 years old . Older people who are not able to withstand intensive chemotherapy have an average survival of 5 – 10 months . 
 AML is treated initially with chemotherapy aimed at inducing a remission ; people may go on to receive additional chemotherapy or a <unk> stem cell transplant . Recent research into the genetics of AML has resulted in the availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person , as well as how long that person is likely to survive . The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic <unk> leukemia ( <unk> ) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same ; AML involves higher percentages of <unk> and undifferentiated cells , including more blasts ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) . 
 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 
 Most signs and symptoms of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells . A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections ; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors , they have no infection @-@ fighting capacity . A drop in red blood cell count ( anemia ) can cause fatigue , <unk> , and shortness of breath . A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma . 
 The early signs of AML are often vague and nonspecific , and may be similar to those of influenza or other common illnesses . Some <unk> symptoms include fever , fatigue , weight loss or loss of appetite , shortness of breath , anemia , easy bruising or bleeding , <unk> ( flat , pin @-@ head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding ) , bone and joint pain , and persistent or frequent infections . 
 <unk> of the spleen may occur in AML , but it is typically mild and <unk> . <unk> node swelling is rare in AML , in contrast to acute <unk> leukemia . The skin is involved about 10 % of the time in the form of leukemia <unk> . Rarely , Sweet 's syndrome , a <unk> inflammation of the skin , can occur with AML . 
 Some people with AML may experience swelling of the <unk> because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue . Rarely , the first sign of leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow , called a <unk> . Occasionally , a person may show no symptoms , and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test .

 A number of risk factors for developing AML have been identified , including : other blood disorders , chemical exposures , ionizing radiation , and genetics .

 " <unk> " blood disorders , such as myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) or myeloproliferative disease ( <unk> ) , can evolve into AML ; the exact risk depends on the type of MDS / <unk> . 
 
 = = = Chemical exposure = = = 
 
 Exposure to <unk> chemotherapy , in particular <unk> agents , can increase the risk of subsequently developing AML . The risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy .
