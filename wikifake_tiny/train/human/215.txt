 In England , burning was a legal punishment inflicted on women found guilty of high treason , petty treason and heresy . Over a period of several centuries , female convicts were publicly burnt at the stake , sometimes alive , for a range of activities including coining and <unk> . 
 While men guilty of heresy were also burned at the stake , those who committed high treason were instead hanged , drawn and quartered . The English <unk> William Blackstone supposed that the difference in sentencing , although " full as terrible to the sensation as the other " , could be explained by the desire not to publicly expose a woman 's body . Public executions were well @-@ attended affairs , and contemporary reports detail the cries of women on the <unk> as they were burned alive . It later became commonplace for the executioner to strangle the convict , and for the body to be burned post @-@ mortem . 
 In the latter half of the eighteenth century , changing attitudes to such public displays prompted Sir Benjamin Hammett MP to denounce the practice in Parliament . His bill , by no means the first such attempt to end the public burning of women , led to the Treason Act 1790 , which abolished the sentence .

 By the end of the thirteenth century , several offences against either one 's lord , or one 's king , were treasonable . High treason , defined as <unk> against the sovereign , was first codified during King Edward III 's reign by the Treason Act 1351 . It clarified exactly what crimes constituted treason , following earlier , somewhat " over <unk> " interpretations of England 's legal codes . For instance , high treason could be committed by anyone found to be <unk> the king 's death or counterfeiting his coin . High treason remained distinct though , from what became known as petty treason : the killing of a lawful superior , such as a husband by his wife . Though twelfth century contemporary authors made few attempts to differentiate between high treason and petty treason , enhanced punishments may indicate that the latter was treated more seriously than an ordinary <unk> . 
 As the most <unk> offence an individual could commit , viewed as seriously as though the accused had personally attacked the monarch , high treason demanded the ultimate punishment . But whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged , drawn and quartered , women were drawn and burned . In his <unk> on the Laws of England the 18th @-@ century English <unk> William Blackstone noted that the sentence , " to be drawn to the <unk> , and there to be burned alive " , was " full as terrible to the sensation as the other " . Blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as " the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly <unk> their bodies " . However , an observation by historian Jules <unk> , that " the first flame to rise consumed the clothes , revealing poor trembling nakedness " , may , in the opinion of historian Vic Gatrell , suggest that this solution is " <unk> " . In The <unk> Tree , Gatrell concludes that the occasional live burial of women in Europe gave tacit acknowledgement to the possibility that a struggling , kicking female hanging from a <unk> could " elicit obscene fantasies " from watching males .

 Another law <unk> by public burning was De heretico comburendo , introduced in <unk> during the reign of Henry IV . It allowed for the execution of persons of both sexes found guilty of heresy , thought to be " <unk> and dangerous to souls , but also <unk> and treasonable . " Bishops were empowered to arrest and imprison anyone suspected of offences related to heresy and , once convicted , send them to be burned " in the presence of the people in a <unk> place " . Although the act was repealed in <unk> / 34 , it was revived over 20 years later at the request of Queen Mary I who , during the Marian <unk> , made frequent use of the punishment it allowed . 
 De heretico comburendo was repealed by the Act of <unk> 1558 , although that act allowed ecclesiastical commissions to deal with occasional instances of heresy . Persons declared guilty , such as <unk> <unk> and Edward <unk> , could still be burned under a writ of de heretico comburendo issued by the Court of Chancery .
