 Demokraten was originally the name of a short @-@ lived newspaper in Hamar started by Leopold <unk> in 1852 , connected to the Marcus <unk> movement . <unk> started a second newspaper , <unk> @-@ <unk> , in Hamar later in 1852 , to compete with his own Demokraten . An organ for the social liberal labour movement in the district , <unk> existed from 1889 to 1892 and was published out of different cities , including in Hamar in the year 1890 . 
 A <unk> chapter of the Labour Party was established in Hedmark in mid @-@ November 1904 . After the <unk> party convention in <unk> in 1906 , the convention summary had to be printed in the <unk> @-@ based newspaper Social @-@ Demokraten , as it lacked its own local newspaper . The county board thus decided to buy 1 @,@ 500 copies of the Social @-@ Demokraten to distribute to its members . There was a growing notion that the party needed its own newspaper . In the same year , the labour movement in <unk> ( south of Hedmark ) bought the paper Solungen , which had existed since 1904 . The takeover came into effect on 1 January 1907 , and publishing began the following year . Solungen pretended to be the labour movement organ for the whole of Hedmark , and outside of <unk> it was published as <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Solungen ) . However , the rest of Hedmark county was not satisfied with this solution .

 The Hamar @-@ based newspaper Demokraten ( " The Democrat " ) was started on 15 September 1909 . The <unk> and first editor was Olav Kringen , who had ample experience as the editor of Social @-@ Demokraten from 1903 until 1906 . Demokraten was the Labour Party organ for the <unk> Cities and Hedemarken , but in its first years it also covered Gudbrandsdalen and Østerdalen , two northern regions . The name <unk> <unk> <unk> was considered for the newspaper , but the historical name Demokraten prevailed . The name was suggested by local Labour MP Karl <unk> . Demokraten 's coverage of Gudbrandsdalen soon ended , and in southern Østerdalen a new labour newspaper , <unk> Arbeiderblad , was set up in 1915 . In northern Østerdalen , <unk> <unk> was popular among the labour movement . According to reports in Demokraten the newspaper again began to cover news from a part of Gudbrandsdalen , namely the city Lillehammer , in 1912 . 
 When it came to building up a new newspaper , Kringen had a certain personal drive , as he ran for parliament in 1909 . When he lost the election , he also lost interest to a certain degree . He resigned in 1912 and Ole <unk> , a member of the <unk> municipal council , took over as chief editor . However , he ran <unk> of other people involved with the newspaper and was fired in 1913 . 
 The newspaper originally had the tagline <unk> <unk> for <unk> ( " Socialist Paper for <unk> " ) , but in 1910 this was changed to <unk> for <unk> ( " <unk> for the Labour Movement " ) .
