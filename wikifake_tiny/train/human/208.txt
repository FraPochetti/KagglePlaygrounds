 Lost Horizons opens with " Elements " , which " blends acoustic guitars , <unk> , synths , <unk> <unk> rhythms , a <unk> harmonica , and ... a falsetto ' doo @-@ doo ' chorus " . <unk> the music is a <unk> , courtesy of English actor John Standing , that lists the basic ' elements ' that make up the world : ash , metal , water , wood , fire , and ( eventually , later in the song ) sky . The second track , " Space Walk " , is set to a recording of Ed White 's 1965 space walk on the Gemini 4 mission . Franglen and Deakin chose to use the sample after listening to an album called Flight to the Moon ( 1969 ) ; the two were struck by how moving and emotive many of the tracks were . Deakin later said , " ' One small step ' leaves me cold , because it was so obviously scripted . But the <unk> â€¦ even after hearing it so many times , it 's so vivid .
