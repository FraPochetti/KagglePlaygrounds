It was the Crimson Tide 's 116th overall season , 77th as a member of the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) and its 19th within the SEC Western Division . The current lineup of Alabama's 2014 football season doesn't change much from the 2010 squad, with the Crimson Tide heading into the 2014 season having more returning starters than any team that has been a member of the Southeastern Conference since the early 1900s. One addition to the 2014 Alabama football team is talented offensive line recruit D.J. Fluker, an offensive tackle from Italy (Edwardsville, Ohio). Fluker has immediately attracted notice for his improvement as an offensive lineman, as in 2014 he has recorded 57 total tackles (52 solo), six forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. Fluker, however, will not be joined on the line by returning Alabama defensive lineman  Tim Williams (Iowa), who will begin his second season with the Tide.  To watch a 2014 Alabama football team game, click on the game in the menu on the left.
