 The 1981 Peach Bowl was a post @-@ season American college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Hurricanes from the University of Miami at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta , Georgia on January 2 , 1981 . The game was the final contest of the 1980 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season for both teams , and ended in a 20 @-@ 10 victory for Miami . 
   Carolina was in the middle of a dominance of their own, having won three of the first four games of the season while tied for the ACC title ( a team always has a slight edge in ACC standings when it comes to total points and the addition of six conference games ) with Miami and Duke. On January 2, Miami beat Virginia Tech, 17-10, on the strength of a scoring effort that included three field goals and two second-half field goals and three yards rushing on the game's opening drive. Virginia Tech's defense finished the contest by holding both teams to a combined 51 yards rushing (3.5 yards per carry) while scoring a touchdown on each of Miami's first three possessions of the second half. Miami shot up to 9-0 heading into the bowl and knocked off Virginia Tech to win the ACC championship that season. The 1984 season was much less successful for Miami. Instead of being the 5th ranked team in the country, Miami was ranked 70th and was coming off of a 1-10 campaign. On January 10, the Hurricanes fell, 23-21, to Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl. 
   The 1985 season was the best year for the 'Canes, and they finished 10-1 and reached the Orange Bowl for the first time since 1978. The 'Canes would sweep the 1994 season, being ranked #1 the following season. In the Sugar Bowl the 'Canes came up just short of defeating Louisiana-Monroe, 17-17 in overtime, but they came up with a shot to knock off #2 Washington, 20-17 in a rematch of the Sugar Bowl of 1975. Washington raced to a 21-0 lead in the third quarter, and then Florida State started to take over the game, scoring first before the refs came out to stop the clock. Florida State then scored five points in the third quarter to pull within one, 24-21. Florida State tried to secure the game, however the FSU defense kept the game close, and eventually Florida State out-scored the Hurricanes 29-20.   The 'Canes made one more trip to the Orange Bowl, but they would not play again until 2006. Georgia Tech was in the middle of a 7-2 season and the Hokies were holding on for dear life at 9-0 heading into the game, and UNC was already in a bowl game, ranked 5th in the country. Both teams were determined to make it to a bowl game. The game started off with three field goals and a touchdown for Georgia Tech, and then it got messy after the first quarter, with Mike Milbury's kids grabbing themselves on the bench in the middle of the second quarter for 'Canes fans to see. 
   A safety on the next drive set the tone for the rest of the game. A field goal on the final play of the first half gave the 'Canes a 20-13 lead, but the Hokies responded with the next drive, adding another field goal to the contest, tying the score at 20. A Tiger pull of the ball in the end zone put the 'Canes in field goal range, but the safety before the kick gave Carolina a chance to win the game. Though, they couldn't, and the 'Canes went ahead for good, 24-21, with a three-and-out by both teams. It was then that Martin went over the top in his final game at FSU, scoring two touchdowns in just over two minutes. It was the final score of a stellar career as FSU's running back, and a deserved win for Martin. 
   The Carolina Football program enjoyed a tremendous run that was not to last, going 12-0 in 1986, and 10-1 in 1987. However, it was the 1989 season, which would have had the distinction of being the first truly impressive run by a program in American college football, that would be the pinnacle of the success of the Tar Heels. A final record of 12-0, 11-0 in 1988 was followed by 8-2 in 1989, but the team was not competitive, finishing 1-11 that year. 1991 saw a change in strategy, with fans demanding that the 'Canes make the Super Bowl after three straight losing seasons. With them on the rise, George Whitfield was named the head coach, and Jim Plunkett joined the team as the offensive coordinator.
