The term  "Hanging Blues" originated from their association with the standard last words spoken by lynchers. Today, the term "Hanging Blues" is used to describe a kind of lighter form of popular music in the South that focuses on family history and heritages, such as funeral music, that was popular during the period of slavery in America. Although I used "Gone with the Wind" in the next paragraph, I have been using "Twilight" and "Malcolm X" interchangeably over the years because  with my earlier studies, I was able to track down the origin of "Twilight"  and how it was born. This is what they said "We sang in the rain, the thunder sounded, we sang on those breezy days; The sky was gray with rain and thunder, My heart beat fast as the night, We cried out for our freedom, our love and our home." This is the core message that was heard in the songs that we can pick and choose our particular versions from as we see fit. It was an effort to resurrect the "great free town folk music" that was common during slavery and which was freely shared on the streets of Savannah, Georgia. The melody was originally written by Fannie Binkley in an 1879 publication called "The Twenties". It has been remixed many times over the years. It was first performed by the original Lee Parker in 1942. The song was included as part of King Crimson's soundtrack album " The Unforgiven ".

Blues and roots
It is important to note that the blues tradition is not simply the music of the South. These songs are based in several genres, including blues,,the blues of R&B, and the blues of gospel and folk music. The relationships that bind these different regions of the United States are often complex. I would argue that the roots of the music lie in each region of the country and that to assume that they all trace their origins to the same kind of humble life of hard work and hard living is to overlook so many facets that connect each area of the United States with another. By concentrating on the classic roots of these blues artists, we are missing the true complexity of the meaning and history behind the music that is.
