After Torchwood: The Series ended with Torchwood, a feature film of the same name was released. It was a much more mature sequel than the second series, dealing with the ongoing hostilities between Torchwood and Earth, as well as the events of Torchwood: A Christmas Carol. It was released in 2009.
"Blessed is the man who believes he knows the origins of things" The choice of song for this episode, "The Origin Of Daggum" (originally heard at 5:24 in the series finale) has been used for Torchwood many times since. It's an early song by the electronic musical group White on Black from their debut album, The Last Gospel. One of the first time the song appeared in Torchwood, it was sung to The Doctor's suggestion.
