 The 1973 Atlantic hurricane season was the first season to use the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale , a scale developed in 1971 by Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson to rate the intensity of tropical cyclones . The season produced 24 tropical and subtropical cyclones , of which only 8 reached storm intensity , 4 became hurricanes , and only 1 reached major hurricane status .  This overall record gives a good sense of the occurrence of major hurricane seasons, but only 30% of major hurricanes form during the period for which the Atlantic hurricane season record was set.
The Atlantic hurricane season is a two-year period when a number of hurricanes form, and thus may be compared to the winter months of the autumn, spring, and summer, each of which includes a number of high-impact cyclones. The total number of hurricanes observed during the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season (248 hurricanes) is less than those in any other previous hurricane season.  These low numbers (based on 48) have often been used as evidence that cyclones cannot form in the near future. [6]  
The moderate number of hurricanes that form in the early autumn of the year, and are rarely called tropical cyclones, also indicates that the climate is likely not to become sufficiently cold to provide the conditions that are needed for the formation of tropical cyclones. If high levels of precipitation, high levels of low-pressure systems (such as from anomalous low-pressure areas), and high levels of radiation from the Sun are present, then the development of tropical cyclones may take place during warm winter months, and is influenced by warm nights and high levels of humidity.
