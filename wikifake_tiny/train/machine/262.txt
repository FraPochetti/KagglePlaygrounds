Sailfish were thought to be extinct in the late 19th century, but the last specimens collected in 1868 were found off the coast of the Philippines. In 1996, 22 specimens were collected off the coast of Riau, Taiwan, before their extinction. They are again being collected from locations across the world, mainly off the coast of North America and eastern Pacific. Some aquaculture related publications, primarily about the fish and its ecology, have provided information about the evolution of the fish species.
