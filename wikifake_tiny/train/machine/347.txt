 Iguanodon ( / <unk> / i @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ don ; meaning " iguana @-@ tooth " ) is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur that existed roughly halfway between the first of the swift bipedal <unk> of the mid @-@ Jurassic and the duck @-@ billed dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous . While many species have been classified in the genus Iguanodon , dating from the late Jurassic Period to the late Cretaceous Period of Asia , Europe , and North America , research in the first decade of the 21st century suggests that there is only one well @-@ <unk> species : I. americanus.
This species is unique among Ornithopoda in that it has a permanent spine at the end of the long neck that is cut through by a second vertebrae with the spine and vertebrae leading together. This animal is fairly similar to other iguanodons from China, Korea, Japan, and Siberia, the only differences being that the higher-end iguanodons generally have a semi-bull-like appearance, whereas this specimen has a smooth, rounded-like appearance and a low, jutting mandible. In mainland China, more recent work has yielded its related species, I. archeni.
