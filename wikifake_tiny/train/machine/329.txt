 Tintin in the Congo ( French : Tintin au Congo ; French pronunciation : <unk> [ <unk> ̃ <unk> o <unk> ̃ go ] ) is the second volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle for its children 's supplement Le Petit Vingtième , it was serialised weekly from May 1930 to June 1931 before being published in a collected volume by Éditions de Petit Vingtième in 1931 . The protagonist of the comic is an inspector called Pascal, a disciple of Leonardo da Vinci, who, after escaping from a boarding school for boys in Congo, is hired to investigate an anomalous pearl.
The former king of Belgium, King Leopold III, became the most visible leader of the Parti Socialiste movement, in which he declared himself to be "impossible" during the First World War, because he had already promised to give Belgium to France during the Peace of Versailles. When the first great outbreak of World War I broke out in 1914, he was one of the leaders of the anti-German Austro-Hungarian party. The title of the comic book was changed to Tintin au Congo (Tintin in the Congo; French pronunciation : èntoin ̃ [un-e-nine ̃] o [un-e-nine ̃] go ] ) in his honor in 1930, and in 1930, it was reprinted in French for the first time by Éditions de Petit Vingtième.
