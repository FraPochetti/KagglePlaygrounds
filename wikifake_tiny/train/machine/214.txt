 The architecture of the Song dynasty ( 960 – 1279 ) was noted for its towering Buddhist pagodas , enormous stone and wooden bridges , lavish tombs , and extravagant palaces . Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand , architectural writing <unk> during the Song dynasty , <unk> into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a <unk> , organized manner . Inscriptions by architects were also discovered in  early Song peripheries. 4. Composition and Texture   The average composition of the Yangtze riverbed of the ancient Yangzhou empire  had incredible variation; reflecting the enormous number of different, seasonal mountains, rivers, and lakes; and the different geomorphological conditions within the imperial province. Three or four dozen people could build and install and place a pagoda each year. Each building had to be designed and constructed, constructed of stone, clay and bricks, according to a specification (usually with at least one level )  and in accordance with architectural standards, from which he (or she) must interpret its intended function, or interpret the how the building was put together, and which stones were used for each level and in what order they were laid.  Each building had to be erected to be acoustically audible and meet the highest needed quality standards  so that the "natural Sound of the Heavens"  would be heard from all four sides and would be enjoyable to walk on.  
Palace and temple architecture was also strongly influenced by the historical and cultural context of the empire. Walls and foundations were built, staircases were constructed, floors and passages were built, and rooms were constructed that were meant to have been sought-after within the limits of the palace and temples. The details of these construction methods and materials remained unchanged in later dynasties, and the foundations were essentially same-aged like the rooms. As a result, in many cases the palace and temple courtyard had no ground-floor, but what used to be a place for sleeping of court nobles was now a common place for domestic servants, household servants, and slaves; the floor was sometimes carpeted, and the walls were often lined with palm-fringed veneer plaster  or painted on in green, yellow, orange, and red hues.  For the temple, often the interior was completely covered by covered stonework that was designed to imitate Chinese seers as seen in the doorways. 5. Appearance and Sizes  Many temple architects were "inspired" by Chinese temple architects. Even after Emperor Wu ( 1217 – 1267 ) had rebuilt his dynasty ( 1250 – 1368 ) as a land-owning monarchy, he continued with his architectural theme. He later created two temples within the gates of his imperial palace in Yangzhou, one that was devoted to his marriage with the wife of the late Emperor Shu (r 1292 – 1302 ), and another dedicated to Zhuangzi. A popular development in the dynasty was the perfect country palace that served as a secluded residence. This style had originally developed in the Tang Dynasty, where it is described as a combination of the greenstone, bluestone, sphinx, and tiger earthenware styles, with many arched windows. Of interest, the original master of all these pre- Tang aristocratic styles (named Lu Shen-shu  (? – 1347 ) ) lived within the Yunnan Province of southern China. Lu Shen-shu was also responsible for the construction of one of the oldest roads in the world (which makes it unique from most major road designs of the time ), along which the Red Country Culture toured the northern China. 6. Replicatory Work  Azhdarch with sculpture (with hand painted name) from the artwork of Zohar Sokal and Ali Áksrab Borns ( c. 200-220 BCE) at Varna, Bulgaria (500-420 BCE)  using acoustical adobe  wall compositions  and brass tiles. Azhdarch offers an interesting study in the physical and functional resonances of the space: a "perfumers"  artistic theory proposes that acoustic reflections reflect acoustic vibrations, and so disturb the spaces between the listener and the music.  Azhdarch comments that these acoustic reverberations "can influence the acoustic resonance of the real acoustic space".  "Perfumers" music - he describes as a form of a combination of traditional classical music (which serves as a linear component of a spatial sound field) and orchestral music - is to be found even in the classical genre; indeed, the orchestra and the conductor.
