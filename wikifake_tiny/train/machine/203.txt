Published: 1952 (of the year) Page: 121 Hardcover Price: $3.50 Weight: 7.31 lbs. ISBN: 0-938915-10-9 (pbk) Synopsis:

This novel by Paul R. King (1921 â€“ 2010) is part of a trilogy of dystopian science fiction novels set in the distant future. The main character is Dusan Leadsom, the creator of a goggle-like device that gives him the ability to see through the eyes of people with complete monocular vision. The rest of the novel is about his character's search for technology that will allow him to take over Earth's government to maintain his utopian society. This 'cyberpunk' world looks very much like a be-gone world. In the book, the name "Cyberpunk" is described as "a mysticic, futuristic kind of science fiction". They do seem to like their world. Also the narrator calls himself "the Capitalist-Fascist kind of corking guy" which makes me very suspicious.

Published: 1962 (of the year) Page: 133 Hardcover Price: $9.95 Weight: 6.02 lbs. ISBN: 0-938915-27-3 (pbk) Synopsis:

A dystopian sci-fi novel by Dredd creator Dave McKean (1950 - ) begins with a sci-fi series set in 2033. In the story, the story of the future is described in detail, and the title of the series is "Demetria" the "Black Times". The futuristic futuristic city is divided into two parts by a seven kilometer wide network of underground tunnels, which provide an alternative transportation link between the two parts. New phases of the technology have to be developed, and every three years a new leader is elected as head of the city. One of the most controversial aspects of the plot is the decision of those who have elected new leaders to essentially abolish work. The workers are told to use their own initiative to help the city flourish. This is the dystopian future. Is it work-free, that's not the point. It's a future where you could a rule the world, but you'd have to work.
