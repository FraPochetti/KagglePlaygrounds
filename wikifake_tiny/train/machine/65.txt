 HMS Marlborough was an Iron Duke @-@ class battleship of the British Royal Navy , named in honour of John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough . She was built at Devonport Royal Dockyard between January 1912 and June 1914 , entering service just before the outbreak of the First World War . She was armed with a main battery of ten 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 340 mm ) guns and was capable of a top speed of 21 @.@ knot. The ship was one of the larger warships to be built at the Devonport Yard and was commissioned on 2 September 1913 and she was transferred to HM Dockyard North Glamorgan in August 1914. Upon the defeat of the German Naval forces in 1916 HMS Marlborough was launched as part of the Allied force in an effort to protect shipping in the Aegean Sea. She remained in service until her loss in the Battle of Jutland on 7 August 1918 and she was decommissioned on 1 February 1922. 
 After the war HMS Marlborough was launched as a museum ship to the public. The ship was submerged in Liverpool Harbour and restored by the RMS Merchant marine Ship Repairs Ltd. However, in 1983, as the ship was being scrapped, she was buried in the seabed under a hangar, an ironic feat, since the vessel had been buried in shallow water while still afloat and was fully on dry land at her day of death. However, a group of divers noticed the submersible's portion of the hull (the critical and vital part of the body) and managed to survive the sinking. The NMC have since been restoring this part of the ship and have added the vital pieces of the ship to the exhibition, including the key to the corner hall. 
 Lighter than steel. She was 200 feet long, 5 feet 11 inches in beam, and 14 feet 7 inches in breadth and weighed 51,500 tons. More amazing is the fact that she was capable of withstanding a 6,000 ton (15,550 tons) ship, her sounder ammunition mechanism also survived the sinking, allowing the attack forces to bomb her into oblivion. The armament was not only 6 @.@ guns. Of course she was not the only one in the Royal Navy armed with these guns, as above is an estimate of the number of Bofors Mark XXXV guns in the Royal Navy. ( These five guns were one third of all of the 2,475 caliber guns in the Royal Navy, so their total tonnage was greater than all the other 2,475 caliber guns combined.)
She was built at Grafton Dockyard in Devonport, and became the flagship of the Royal Navy, being her first defence line during the war. The ship was ultimately cruised from the opposite end of the North Sea to Crete in which case she reached Amalfi in February 1915. From here she went to northern Turkey and Gibraltar to ensure the safety of the Mediterranean Fleet when war broke out. As she was drawn into the conflict in the Mediterranean Sea she was unable to conduct air patrols and remained close to the fleet. During the war, she was dismasted by allied aircraft and sank with her crew who refused to make way for the sinking ship. Following the war, she was transferred to the Royal Naval Shipyard at Gosport and after the warship war past her last voyage in November 1917 (to Italy, where she was broken up in 1945 ) she was transferred to the Navy Museum in Portsmouth. 
Â Exterior.
Despite the small size of the ship, the ship was quite impressive and memorable. Though strictly an iron ship, she had a railed superstructure with three at.@ manhole covers ( with a 35 inch clearance between the inner and outer manhole covers, a plan of the ship, and other illustrations which were based on data provided by Wikipedia ). Below is a view of her interior from inside, via the manhole covers.
In the future, we will not consider the construction, distribution and deployment of gun ports, but will instead look at the visual display of the ship's array of weaponry.
