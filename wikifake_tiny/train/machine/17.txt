The game features an anthropomorphic <unk> named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. <unk> , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos <unk> . Dr. <unk> is more powerful than Dr. Eggman and more evil than Tails.
The game's music is composed of several songs of Sonic the Hedgehog including his theme, "Sonic Boom", "Sonic's Theme" and "You're The Hero". Each of the songs contain lyrics to make them sound like original songs, in addition to being recognizable segments of the music. The original game also has an original costume and some character unlockables, which take advantage of the Sega Genesis' ability to register sounds as sounds with multiple keystrokes. An advanced arcade version of the game was published by Konami on the Sega Master System, and was to be published as Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric for the Neo Geo Pocket Color video game console. Unfortunately, the Sega Master System and Genesis's technology was beyond the abilities of the developers to modify. The arcade version is still in existence and it was released in January 1991 in Japan for the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis.
