 Tropical Storm Olaf was an erratic and long @-@ lived tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to regions of Mexico , which would be devastated by Hurricane Pauline a week later . The sixteenth named storm of the 1997 season , Olaf formed on September 26 off the southern coast of Mexico . It moved northward and quickly intensified , reaching peak winds of 70 mph ( 120 km / h ) before weakening and hitting Oaxaca as a tropical depression . Olaf made landfall on November 12 as a tropical storm in the area between Coatzacoalcos and Barzilero, Mexico. At high tide it was slightly further west than the Mexico State at Coatzacoalcos and a few meters further east than Coatzacoalcos State. (   https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-07/uot-vbvbf-jul1320150118.php ). The annual count on August 10 found that 71.5% of the Mexican territory was under tropical storm status. On the 19th the La Comandante de Olaf acquired height, reached peak wind speeds of 86 mph ( 145 km / h ), and then weakened. Three days later, on the 25th Olaf moved eastwards, slowly weakening as it moved eastward, reaching peak winds of 42 mph ( 64 km / h ) in mid-Oaxaca. Upon reaching the Gulf of Mexico, it turned northeast and briefly tracked northward. When it finally passed south of the Mexican State of Coatzacoalcos, Olaf had weakened to just three max i tys ( 10 max  ) and lost maximum gale force winds of 40 mph ( 55 km / h ) as it continued northward.

This is not a discussion of whether a tropical cyclone makes sense in a specific place. The question of why the future formation of a tropical cyclone does not have such a pattern is a more fundamental question. In the Southern hemisphere if a tropical cyclone does make a landfall in a specific location, one of the largest reasons why it's not a cyclone is that the rotation of the Earth would push the storm inland. As a tropical cyclone travels through its lifetime, the ocean speeds it up to such a pace that it never makes landfall (although it can cause destructive rainfall), and the winds pushing the storm inland don't cause it to come ashore.

Gibson was the best American pitcher of the 20th century.  They won the World Series in 1929 and 1945. It was also the first year that the Mets won the pennant.  http://www.baseball-reference.com/calendar/1875/1876/1877/1878/Nationals/Baseball/Athletics/1929/[o.c.][?table=inn]  
 You can still win the World Series, even at the Museum of Old and New York, if you want.  http://www.historycenter.org/single.aspx?p=45467
When you're at the Museum of Old and New York, you can even participate in a trivia night.  Here are the rules for all the trivia nights: 1) The ball game starts at 8:30pm, but it's not that late. 2) So we're allowed to do a lot of drinking, but that's ok too. We're allowed to stay up late. 3) There are six buckets and there are five friends each. 4) Everyone will have to fill out a shirt. 5) The bucket with the best shirts will win a free trip to the World Series. 6) There will be prizes for each answer and everyone can sign up on the day of the game to win a ticket. By being in the Museum of Old and New York, you are going to a ball game.  Staying with a big group is awesome, but there will be some partying going on too. Try to keep the groups together so that you can keep the fun going. If you want to talk baseball, the Museum of Old and New York can be the only place to do it.
