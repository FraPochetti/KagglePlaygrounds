 The O 'Brien class of destroyers was a class of six ships designed by and built for the United States Navy shortly before the United States entered World War I. The O 'Brien class was the third of five classes of destroyers that were known as the " thousand tonners " , because they were the first U.S. destroyers over 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ <unk> t ) displacement . The other four classes ( E 'Brien, H 'Brien, I 'Brien and J 'Brien ) were also 7@,@ 000,000 long tons displacements. Both E and H and I were " century olds ", the third, fourth, and fifth largest in the U.S. Navy and were the most ancient class in the Pacific fleet, as of the beginning of World War I. A seventh class of ships was built for Europe. The class was awarded two rather cheap navies. The O'Brien class also has the oldest naval armament in the U.S. Navy ( two 7 in 76mm ( M1917) guns which could fire 8,000 rounds per minute ), and the heaviest American heavy cruiser of all time, the USS Halsey.

The O'Brien class first attacked an enemy of superior numbers and strength on the Continent in December, 1915. It was the first major act of war, and included a few major victories. From February, 1916, the O'Brien class cruised over Sicily. The Italian war of the spring and summer of 1916 involved the Italian Navy in two completely separate, but ever-illuminating conflicts: (i) the murder of eleven hundred refugees from Sicily in April; and (ii) the invasion and occupation of Northern Italy by Italian and allied troops in the May and June of 1916. The war was an acrimonious one between the Italian and allied navies, the native Italians fighting first, the native Italians repulsed by the Allies. The O'Brien class was sometimes called a " duel " between the allied forces and the Italian resistance.

The M1917 guns of the O'Briens were replaced by 9 in 75mm ( M1924) in 1914; the M1919 guns were added in 1917. The M1921 guns were still a replacement for the M1917s. O'Brien was the only ship in the U.S. fleet (class or in the world) to receive the operational and procurement prefixes M1917B; the O'Brien name was also applied to the cruiser over 1,000 tons. Both the enemy (whom the cruiser was attacking) and the cruiser (which was engaged in offensive action) were assigned distinct names; "O'Brien" was an abbreviation for the " O'Brien Class" destroyer; "Halsey" was a name for the most modern cruiser in the fleet, the USS Halsey, which earned her other name, the Halsey. The main armament, in three masted catapults, was the largest class of gun ships in U.S. Naval history; it included 2 @,@ 90mm ( M1924) twin mounts. The M1919 was probably the most reliable gun that the U.S. Navy had at the time. Two masted catapults could be fitted in the bow of each ship, and two masted catapults could be installed in the stern of the O'Brien class. Each separate crew member had a private "battlement" for the gun; the guns were controlled by each individual gunner or gunner's station; each gunner had 2 day duty officers, 2 gun master assistants, 2 steering officer, 2 torpedo master assistants and 2 discharger stations; 1 six-man lifeboat team, and 1 man overboard ventilator team; the gun crew had to be closely coordinated.
