 The Gambia women 's national football team represents the Gambia in international football competition . The team , however , has not competed in a match recognised by FIFA , the sport 's international governing body , despite that organised women 's football has been played in the country since 1998 . The Gambia has two youth teams , an under @-@ 17 side that has competed in FIFA U @-@ 17 Women 's World Cup qualifiers , and an under @-@ 19 side that withdrew from regional qualifiers for an under @-@ 19 World Cup . Most Gambians use smartphones to access the Internet, but the government prefers either personal computers or mobile phones, even for individuals who can not afford one of these. For now, our team is stuck watching pornography, and we have turned off our computers when we see a movie. We also try to avoid most adult related content on the Internet. To make life easier for our team, some of the football plays used are not restricted to women's soccer and are able to be sung by men too. The Gambia's national team won World Cup 2002 in Australia and qualification for 2003 FIFA World Cup in Germany, but they are currently ranked 1.001 in the FIFA World Ranking, which is equivalent to 515 men in the African continent.
So did the team win again in the second match? " Don't be scared, we are strong, " panted Saara, her school-age daughter seated next to her, excitedly, and sat next to Minnezi. " We are the big dogs in our country." The entire shearing squad burst into cheers, and those that weren't asked to leave quickly had to sit with their arms wrapped around their shoulders.
