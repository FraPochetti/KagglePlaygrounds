 The <unk> Boat Race took place on 29 March 2008 . Held annually , the event is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Oxford won the race . Oxford 's crew featured the oldest competitor in Boat Race history . The race took place in very difficult weather conditions – strong winds and heavy rain – resulting in the slowest winning time in over sixty years . A real Boating Event: The race began with the midday start time. Out of the dozens of boats involved in the race, only 6 boats left London before 5pm. The fastest time of the day was 5.5 hours for Oxford. Universities carried out a vigorous rowing training programme throughout the day. At midday, there were around 200 runners in each row to complete three laps of the Thames River. The race was split into two sets of five at intervals of 5 minutes. By 7pm, 9.25 hours after the starting time, Oxford had completed all of its five sets of five laps. In the afternoon, Michael Turner's boat put in a good lap of the Thames with good weather to go with it. But the pace was high for his crew, the contrast being that his team had less speed and the breeze was stronger than expected for the strong forecast. Attempts were made to slow down as a result of the unpredictable weather. Vinganoux'boat had been slower and their difficult start was just a part of their overall race. In the afternoon, Cambridge's 2 x 2 x 2 team lost to Oxford's 2 x 4 x 2 team in the race for the final place. In the end, Michael Turner won with a time of 5.48 hours.

Only one black van. 02-29-2011, 07:36 AM #21 cgoddess Location: New York, NY 3,017 posts, read 8,740,120 times Reputation: 1064 Quote: Fox2 Originally Posted by Right there at Hartley Way, Oxford, in the place you parked your car after the big round of the Lottery. Only one black van. What's the story with Merchant Street Jazz? Do they have a boat somewhere close? Will we see them on the Channel

& his stint is history

Can't decide if these guys will push me into running "Fatboy" or "Blackwater"?


They are gyrating

Raft up a river, 70 knot: E, 1MPH : A, 25K Not sure which and I got rid of both when they sat me down and tried to make me sleep in a hot box with lots of oversize sleeping bags. Two days later they turned up and talked a bunch of BS about two other bands called "Beneath Your Skin" and "Demolition". It was just a bit of a waste of time though, seeing as nobody has made a TV movie or anything for 10 years or so. Anyone want to cut me some slack, the post is posted 2 nights ago and I have to jump around in it to see whats going on. 02-29-2011, 07:40 AM #22 cgoddess Location: New York, NY 3,017 posts, read 8,740,120 times Reputation: 1064 Quote:Fox2 Originally Posted by It was just a bit of a waste of time though, seeing as nobody has made a TV movie or anything for 10 years or so.
