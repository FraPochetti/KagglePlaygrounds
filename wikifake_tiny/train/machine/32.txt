Hu disappeared from public life for about half a century, and was finally recaptured by a new regime in 1920. He was trained as a samurai by <unk>, a tradition that operated in China before the country founded its own imperial family. Hu wrote a policy paper for the <unk> Yuan dynasty, but was exiled to some rural ghettos, where he lost touch with the outside world. In 1942, he was killed by a bomb planted by Chinese intelligence.
