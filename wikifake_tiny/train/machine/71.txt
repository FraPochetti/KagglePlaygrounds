I like my forecasts
Rank : -2
Extension of SPSS2013
I recommend using SPSS2013. Lots of old data, lots of tabulations and lots of variables added. Overall performance is a big improvement compared to SPSS.
I like the first version
Rank : -1
I wasn't as enthusiastic about the first version. No way this version was going to achieve 5.2.2. After improving the forecast I started thinking that there was a better way to get the "best-fit" R-projection from a number of 'current state' models that all needed to be in some specific range for the  future and associated
... then I quickly realized that to get a good result of 6.1.0 I would have to include the GTM models at some spot and that it would take a lot of work and it would be possible that if I only had enough data for the first version that I would just need to add in GTM from the 1.6.2 version. The reason that I included both GTM and combined GTM in the first version was to get the best-fit R-projection at the beginning.
I then saw that we had not been able to test the SPSS2013.3 version and if we could all run R-projections from it we could determine that it was the better choice
The idea was that if we knew a few more  experts who could make comparisons and provide  better quality, we could bring in other experts who could run R-projections from the different  projects and use their knowledge to further improve the results.
Discovery class
The overall goal of the Discovery class is to demonstrate that a set of observations, which are being used in a model, are meaningful to describe real-world data. In a sense this is a R-projection.
