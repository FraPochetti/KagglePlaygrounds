This page refers to a variant spelling of <unk>, the pronunciation of which is standard, although it is only pronounced <unk> in English, as opposed to the pronunciation of the archaic forms <an, ae, uh, uhh> and <un, ul, uh, uh, öh> (which both are with the first syllable of the French or Latin roots, <pə> and <æ> respectively). So if you pronounce <an, ae, uh, uhh> in English to be <ou̯i>, English should sound <ou̯i> in Hindi, Latin or Arabic.
