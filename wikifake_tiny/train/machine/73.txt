Tiger and Golden Stallion : "Golden" stallions = 27.7 kg at the height of the grass.  Only one breed of this has been described : the Wundersor. 
Once seen as the largest stallion of South Africa, the Kruger White Stallion has been reduced by the use of radiation and other methods to achieve his Mature size. In this breed, the Mature cock is up to 45 cm in length, with mature tail, a very high mounded profile, a higher testosterone level, less fat, and higher carnitine output, even in full grown animals. One of its advantages is that the white of the head shows well against the dark color of the body.
Color differences :  One of the most significant differences between white stallions and black stallions is the underlying color of the skin, compared to that of black, red, and red and white mares. White stallions have a dark colored back of the mane, with blue lines, while blacks, with a reddish-brown color, have black hair with black lines.
Size variations :  On average, a white stallion is 10 to 15 kilograms at maturity, when the coat color will be red. Also, white stallions are usually around 25 cm at the hind legs and 10 to 12 cm at the forelimbs when they reach full maturity. 
Wings : The wing cross section is greatly wider than that of black stallions, but darker, blackish, gray-yellow, and even black with a white stripe. This is due to the rougher bracing pattern of the skin, with a hump at the mid-thigh and cowl. A slightly thicker body and more robust tail are also used to increase their ability to lift heavy loads. Black with white stripes will also have white stumpy, air like hairs on the outer edge of the back of the forelimbs. There are several different colors of black-on-white gall-of-fowl for breeding: 
1. White – Yellow-colored Black-on-White male; with red or white markings. Usually the mare is white with a yellow fowl backing. White-on-white foals are mated between August and October, and they give birth between April and May. The puppies are about 4 months old when they reach the males' weight. Red-colored, black and white-striped white foals are most common, however, the most significant can also be white-on-red and white-on-green. Male: 5.6 kg and mated female: 6.5 kg. Blue-on-blue foals are also produced. White-on-white or black-on-white foals are not as common as their offspring. The white tail tip of these males is black, while the white back is almost black.
