 " Kir 'Shara " is the ninth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise . It was writer Michael Sussman 's third episode of the season , while it was director David Livingston 's second . The episode was the third in a three @-@ part story arc , following on from the episodes " The Forge " and " Awakening " . " Kir 'Shara " and the Vulcan arc showed themes relating to the Protestant Reformation resulting in comparisons to books such as The Da Vinci Code and The Celestine <unk> , while the Kir 'Shara itself was compared to the Nag Hammadi library . The episode itself centered on a story with no clear resolution, with Kirk, Spock, and an android named Q on the search for the truth about an ancient machine which controls time and space. [2] This was the first episode directed by Robert Meyer Burnett and the first to feature a senior screenwriter. The episode was a benefit of the 20th Anniversary of Star Trek. It was later, in 2371, released as part of the "Pirates of the Inner Space" series.

(22 February 2017, Star Trek: Communicator issue 145, p. 41) The Xindi Commander, who, at the time, was only known as Kir'Shara's surname (Kir means "Terrace", the surname "Shara" may derive from a surname which means "Captain"), is present at the end of the episode. [3] However, the episode's script originally had nothing to do with this.

Producer Gene Roddenberry referred to "Kir 'Shara", even in the middle of the episode, as a matter of "little surprise." (Star Trek: Communicator issue 144, p. 40) In the second draft script, for instance, Kir'Shara and T'Pol were still unidentified aliens in their native Talarian language. [4] The Talarian homeworld was first introduced in "A Taste of Armageddon", aired 5 September 1966. [5]

Julian Bashir said of Kir'Shara, " It's like they wanted a Klingon kind of mission. I guess they tried, but no man likes a bitch." When asked if this remark had been meant to imply he had liked Kirk, he replied, "You wouldn't understand." [6]

." When asked if this remark had been meant to imply he had liked Kirk, he replied, "You wouldn't understand." In the novel The Sphere by Joe Haldeman, the writers explained that the fate of Kir'Shara in Star Trek is not set until "Relics" (p. 83). The Sphere has additional versions of the traitors Kir'Shara, S'Kreel and Shana in its addition, called "Kir'sqar" by the writers. It was stated that because the story of Kir'Shara is part of the future timeline, Kir'Shara's fate is altered during "Relics" but at the time of the novel's main story, "The Sphere", Kir'Shara had yet to die.

The novel noted that Krall was somewhat of a useless nerd.
