 Corpus Christi Bay is a scenic semi @-@ tropical bay on the Texas coast found in San <unk> and Nueces counties , next to the major city of Corpus Christi . It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by Mustang Island , and is fed by the Nueces River and Oso Creek from its western and southern extensions , Nueces Bay and Oso Bay . The bay is located approximately 136 miles ( 219 km ) south of San Antonio , and 179 miles ( 288 km ) southwest of Houston . The bay's 400 foot (~10.4 meter) elevations make it one of the tallest known estuaries in the world, at 1,890 feet (400 m) above sea level. The sea level is high, standing at 678 feet (~185 m) in recent years. The Bay is a natural barrier reef formed by the combined tidal action of the Nueces River and Oso Creek, as well as the buoyancy of the Gulf of Mexico, that extends west into the Gulf of Mexico. The Bay is now connected by the Oso Creek Bridge in San Antonio and the Corpus Christi Port Bridge in Corpus Christi.
