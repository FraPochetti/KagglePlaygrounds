 " President Evil " is the fifth episode of the third season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars , and the forty @-@ ninth episode overall . Written by Jonathan Moskin and David Mulei and directed by Nick Marck , the episode premiered on The CW on October 31 , 2006 . 
 The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars ( Kristen Bell ) as she deals with life as a college student while <unk> as a private detective . 
This episodes features Catherine Schock ( Veronica Mars  ) as two-time MS13 member & criminal partner Kat Sanchez (and her pregnant fiancé Jake) and about as sexy as one could imagine. This episode features the most number of first-born females (but fourth overall) in the entire series. 
This was also the only Veronica Mars  "firsts" in which the pilot was just 1 word, in fact, this was the only pilot episode where the title was announced at the beginning of the episode. 
The show was renewed for a second season on August 7, 2010. 
This episode is a good example of how TV works. 
Thus the #PIVOT success rate goes as follows: 2:1 for <-$#$&%**> viewers, 2:1 for $@#@##&!&!! subscribers, 1:1 for ________________________. 
Since I started watching this, a bunch of other same-day shows have had PIVOT ratings better than this. First is CBS's Elementary.  This is the highest rated CBS show in history (and almost every other network television show); it holds a #4 rating in PIVOT. 
Next is VH1's Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which has been the highest rated show in PIVOT for a year now. 
The next is even higher: the hottest show of the year on cable, AMC's The Walking Dead.
Then there's HBO's latest hit, Veep, which is usually the #1 comedy show in PIVOT. 
Of course we haven't touched on shows from Showtime, NBC, Discovery, or CBS yet. You should check out these for starters: the Incredible Jessica James  as high school freshman Kira Gilbert  and Academy Award-nominated actress Janet Varney as her guidance counselor. 
All of these first-born females have had higher than average PIVOT participation (and almost all of them have had their dating seasons on the high-rated programming), and none of them have had an average low PIVOT rating. Thus all of this information is available to every TV fan out there. 
Of course you could just look at the various show charts online, but I find it much more fun to actually do something like this. First of all, the only show at #1 in PIVOT, and by far the highest rated one, is VH1's Fun & Fancy Free, the show everyone is dying to watch this summer. VH1 has 3 different age brackets; the highest ratings are for 18-24, who actually watch our competition when it comes to the shows, and the lowest are for those between 25-54, who only binge their cable shows. Also of note is that these are show ratings for the last week of the year. Since the higher the ratings the lower the perceived value of the show, this could be useful in keeping you from flocking to a show that may have low ratings and will likely struggle in the ratings before it even gets there. But then there are shows like The Howard Stern Show, that has a low PIVOT rating of 1.5, but quite consistently brings in a lot of viewers. The social network we have around our families makes this information available through a feed, but in this case I've used the top TV channel from the cable provider to determine the ratings.
