Trucks traveling the main trunk highway would have an opportunity to bypass SR 319: the main trunk highway is renamed Interstate 90. However, the alternate main trunk route will be the only option for most trucks traveling the N-State highway through Burkettsville. The Interstate 90 port side exit is not available to trucks in the south fork of SR 319. Most trucks will simply pull right (east) to the next shoulder between Ogden and Washington streets on the west side of the H&S or US90 expressway.
Now, it is very important to know about the "H&S Expressway."
The North / South Shields Road Bridge, on SR 318 (the main trunk highway between Cincinnati and H&S ) is a safety hazard and a permanent obstruction in the same state as the south branch of the Ohio River (x = width of SR 318). In the video you will see that trucks carrying organic cotton require approximately 25 miles to move across the N- State bridge to enter Indiana. This isn't good for the cotton producers since their products are vulnerable to breakage and variances in weather, wind speed, and "weathering."
So, with all the two-lane highways that we might see in the coming year (and many might not even exist), what are you doing? Running a pair of turns into Ohio from Burkettsville for an extra batch of cheap corn? If you are a small producer of organically grown corn or soybeans, you must consider this bottleneck.
