 West Hendford Cricket Ground was a first @-@ class cricket ground located in Yeovil , Somerset . The land for the ground was first leased by Yeovil Cricket Club in 1874 , and was also used for a range of other sports , most significantly hosting Yeovil Rugby Club in the 1890s , and then again from 1935 until the ground was closed . Significant improvements were made to the ground during the 1930s , including the opening of a new pavilion , jointly funded by the Rugby and Cricket clubs . The ground was also involved in the course racing, and was heavily involved in the world cup circuit in the late 19th century. The venue has been used for many sporting events and is one of the top ball sports venues in the West of England. The ground has three main categories of fans - fans of fast bowling, supporters of middle fast bowling, and fans of nines.      New additions to the ground are the integrated volleyball courts, the auditorium with no pitch for the evening sessions, and the panel tables. Also changes were made to the building from the 1920s, which had been built with an average of 637 standard pitches (now 120 as a result of the abandonment of match pitches in 1993 ). The building also includes the grounds-side range of more than 150-130 cricket wickets from which practice sessions can be held at all times.
