 Live & Kicking is a BBC Saturday morning children 's magazine programme , running from 1993 to 2001 . The fourth in a succession of Saturday morning shows , it was the replacement for Going Live ! , and took many of its features from it , such as phone @-@ ins , games , comedy , competitions and the showing of cartoons . Once Live & Kicking had become established in series two , it reached its height in popularity during series four , when it was presented by Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston ; their final episode won a BAFTA award . The format is typical of the one at the heart of all children's shows, as live and kicking, 'objects' and'masks' are similar to those on Showcase and the later Jimmy Neutron and Pinky and the Brain.
TV's Living With/Learning With :
The Living With Programme is currently shown on BBC1, which was originally broadcast on ITV before entering the BBC's 2nd semi-prohibition period. Two programmes are produced per year, but the programme can be shifted up or down depending on demand, as it has been shown in recent times on various Fridays and Wednesdays, from 23:30 to 00:30. In the past, it was shown on Thursdays at 00:00 and then again at 04:00, which fell out of favour as people didn't want to listen to a show on break (as it was normally heard while watching a film or rather, not someone talking).
In 1997 the programme was brought to the UK via Channel 4, which ran it on weekends for a week on their Family Channel and as a Saturday morning show, which ran it from 23:00 until 02:00, and then again from 01:00 until 04:00 in 1999. In 2002, it was brought to BBC4, which was aired as a whole programme in some parts of the UK, and then as a series from 05:00 to 09:00 and then as a Season 2 from 10:00 to 11:00, to run for 12 weeks. An expanded version of the programme was then made available to subscribers in the US, starting with the 3rd month in 2003. TV Guide Weekly's "Top Ten Kids' Programs for 2003" list.
TV's Super Bowl :
BBC Three has specialised in the Super Bowl for many years, as its first episode was aired in 1966, starring Fergie, and then between 1970 and 1976, it was broadcast from New York City. The programme was subsequently re-broadcast in 1976 and 1977, from London, and then again in 1977, in association with which they were able to secure the rights to broadcast the regular format. The Super Bowl is a special occasion in itself; TV Sports Radio presents the football games which are usually filmed at Wembley, the programme which presents them is special, and also airs the events which feature in the Super Bowl itself. In 1998, the programme went semi-pro in England, the last game being screened in Manchester, with some events being aired as specials on Channel 4; it continues to broadcast in the UK today. It ran for 9 weeks in 1998 and later was extended to 12 weeks (still airing regularly in the UK), beginning with one last game, which was televised in 2001 on ITV, with the introduction of Toddlers and Tiaras. In the USA, the Super Bowl has been shown from Denver to New Orleans, from 2002 to 2005, and in the UK, it is hosted by the West Coast mainstay, the University of California - Los Angeles, with the first televised game in 2010 taking place in San Francisco, US.
TV's Local Night/ Good Night At The Stadium :
 So called from the fact that it presents one night a week at some local watering holes, you know, the rest of the UK and Ireland take a long weekend off, or that some locals are preparing for the American Presidential Elections. It is the former, very late nights, where most of us have taken the piss out of the EU and done the same to the UK and Europe. The show used to be on BBC TV, usually on Friday nights, until it was bought by Channel 4 in 1997, and then later relaunched on ITV. In its various incarnations, it is one of those comedy shows which have been available to us since the early 2000s, and in some ways has become the staple of television through no fault of its own. However, due to the mind-blowing penetration of the internet and how ubiquitous it is in our society, it has been constantly thwarted by the likes of Google and many of the streaming companies like Netflix, Spotify and so on, with some making their own stand-alone devices. A similar project, Home Night on BBC One, was set up in 2009, where local celebrity doormen from London stand-up clubs played the show, often featuring no others but themselves.
