 Hurricane Abby was the only tropical cyclone in the Caribbean Sea during the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season . The second tropical cyclone and first named storm season , Abby developed on July 10 from a tropical wave in the vicinity of the Lesser Antilles . Abby rapidly intensified into a hurricane after being a tropical storm for less than six hours . It briefly peaked as a category 2 hurricane before weakening back .
A violent wind outbreak caused the vessel to lose power in late August. Unfortunately, Hurricane Abby proved to be a dark horse in the hurricane season. At its peak, the hurricane formed about 1,000 miles off the coast of the US Virgin Islands, before changing course towards the Caribbean on August 31. The hurricane did not make landfall. Â Harvey made landfall on September 2, and initially appeared to be a weak tropical storm.
