 Hoysala literature is the large body of literature in the Kannada and Sanskrit languages produced by the Hoysala Empire ( <unk> – <unk> ) in what is now southern India . The empire was established by <unk> Kama II , came into political prominence during the rule of King Vishnuvardhana ( 1108 – <unk> ) , and declined gradually after its defeat by the <unk> dynasty invaders in <unk> . This resurgence is known as the <unk> Civilisation. A complete account of the language, literature and culture of the <unk> culture can be found in <unk> literature – Hoysala literature. The Hoysala literature comes from central India, occupies a considerable area of the present-day South, from Kashmir to Karnataka, and predates and was inspired by the <unk> culture. The Hoysala literature is divided into three main branches, each having its own symbolic and pragmatic vocabulary. This section, however, primarily deals with the period before 1781, in the context of the <unk> Civilisation. This study will focus on the other two branches, the five dialects of the <unk> culture and its origin and background. 
The <unk> culture, which included the vast majority of the people who were in the <unk> area, came to an end in 1845. Although <unk> culture is still valued today as part of the Hoysala culture, <unk> culture has now become marginal to the extent that no material sign of it is to be found.
