Although several of these games will feature Boise State vs Boise State this year, the fans and media have been asking what about the 6-0-1 Boise State of 2008 that met Boise State in the 2011 Hawaii Bowl, since they'll be taking the same team out in Hawaii for their sixth meeting since the Hawaii Bowl expanded into a 3-team bowl, one year earlier than its predecessor from the 2017-18 season.
"I think the most important thing we should have learned from the Hawaii Bowl in 2007 was how the West played against the East.  The West spent three weeks in the conference championship game.  That's a classic conference championship game and we had the standard for what a championship game was.  The West got outplayed.  I don't know that we're going to give that standard to us again.  I'm not here to pick a rematch.  This is our sixth championship game, and all seven of them have been all-time great games.  It just depends on the division champion, and with the safety of both teams playing well and doing what's best for the schools, I don't think that's the time to do that." - Bronco Sonny Lubick, USF, on the Hawaii Bowl controversy.

But that isn't to say that the Hawaii Bowl does not provide the best opportunity for a winning Boise State team to reach the national stage. With a 20-2-1 record at the Hawaii Bowl, the Broncos are 1-0 in their last 4 game, and they're only 5-5-1 against all those Western Conference teams. You can go back to 1990 to find that the undefeated Montana Grizzlies opened the Hawaii Bowl with a 25-21 loss to the No.
