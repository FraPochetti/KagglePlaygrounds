 Superman : Escape from Krypton ( originally known as Superman : The Escape ) is a steel <unk> roller coaster located at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia , California . When it opened in 1997 , it was the tallest roller coaster in the world , and its speed of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) was tied for the fastest with Tower of Terror II , a similar roller coaster which opened two months earlier at Dreamworld in Australia .
In 1991, the following year, a new coaster called Behemoth was built in its place. As of 2017, Behemoth is no longer in service.
About 8,000 people would ride that roller coaster in one day. In February 2018, it was replaced by Hollywood Princess coaster.
The ride will still be able to be ridden as of 2018. However, park officials would not confirm if or when it might be closed to the public.
