 The Temple of Eshmun ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> ) is an ancient place of worship dedicated to Eshmun , the Phoenician god of healing . It is located near the Awali river , 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) northeast of Sidon in southwestern Lebanon . The site was occupied from the 7th century BC to the 8th century AD , suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of Sidon . The Temple of Eshmun was probably the only place of worship in the pre-Islamic/Roman-era Levant where Eshmun was worshiped. However, other existing buildings at the Temple of Eshmun and the Uksesan plateau (in eastern Lebanon ) may represent pre-Islamic (11th to 6th century BC) religious buildings as well as the cities of Sidon and Sidon, in the vicinity of the Temple of Eshmun and the Uksesan plateau. The Temple of Eshmun is the most prominent of all the temples associated with Eshmun.
There were four temples built by Eshmun at Sidon, with the earliest and largest building being the Jerusalem Temple, which was the first temple of a fourth generation. The structure also contained a basement containing an underground chamber. In the sixth century AD, a smaller temple, which was discovered in an archeological site not far from Sidon in 2006, and first dated to the 6th century BC, was discovered and dated to the second generation of the Eshmun cult. It is unclear how much of this temple was dedicated to Eshmun, and whether it was still serving the cult or not by the early tenth century AD. At the same time, an early chapel, representing the Second Temple, was discovered just north of the Temple of Eshmun. These other temples continue to be well known and are also indicative of pre-Islamic/Roman Jewish and Christian involvement in the Levant. [2]
After the Islamic conquest in 639, the Temple of Eshmun was in a state of disrepair. The prominent partition wall around the east temple was not well maintained, and one temple vault containing religious objects, including human bones, had collapsed in an earthquake in 657 AD. [3] It is likely that there was an international boycott of the Temple of Eshmun by the Arab community (especially the Hittites) in the Levant (639-759) following the same fate of the Temple of Sol in Israel ( 658-680) (see [4] for more details ).  A more important aspect of the situation in the early Islamic era is the inscription in the west wall of the Temple of Eshmun :
Adams 27:8:
" In the Land of Eshmun He finished building the walls of the Eshmun Temple, and also the wall of Jerusalem. His Temple is a lamp for the guidance of the lights of the heavens; He shows it in full daylight with its wicks and ointments. I shall now take your dead from this place, and You shall bring them back to the Sanctuary. I shall punish with death every imaam who sends a person as an imaam, or as a ziyarat from his own land, or sends a person to intercede for him, or in the name of religion, makes a person go astray from his faith or dissolves his tree, or calls him out to go astray."

It is of great importance to understand the key political and religious factors in the early Islamic period of the history of the Levant.   Considering the historical focus of the modern Syrian conflict, and that Eshmun, the most powerful of the Holy Places in the late medieval and early modern period, is a familiar/dominant icon of the Levant's political and religious development, we should carefully consider the context of religious tensions surrounding the Temple of Eshmun.
The key social unit and jurisdiction of Eshmun is the household of Eshmun-Akkad, who is the sister of Eshmun-Succad and the mother of Eshmun. The house of Eshmun-Akkad consists of a male head of household, one or two female servants, and the slave of Eshmun. All of these houses are seen as significant in the narrative of the early Islamic era.
