 " Exit Through the <unk> @-@ E @-@ Mart " is the fifteenth episode of the twenty @-@ third season of the American animated television sitcom The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 4 , 2012 . In the episode , Bart is punished by Homer after causing trouble . He gets revenge on his father by <unk> @-@ painting images of him with the word " <unk> " all over Springfield . He also gives himself a new joke name, Mart. I think there is a joke about the word " _ke_ ". It's a bad word.
