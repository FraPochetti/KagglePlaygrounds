<unk> <unk> <unk> Aretusa served on several battleships of the Italian American War and the Russian-American War. She was sunk off the New Jersey coast during the Russian-American War in 1885, but she was never repaired.
Her modifications included the addition of two keel-driven heavy catapults, one in the bow and one on the foremast. The French architect Jean-Pierre Candelac (Impact) and Le Corbusier (used in the Ministère de l'Industrie Monastique (ministère privé) ) designed Aretusa in the 1890s, after seeing its visual design features in a French Magazine, the French Agency Des Notaires. This was finished in April 1898 and renamed after her, due to the name -Evita. Aretusa achieved fame in 1894 by sinking three Austrian battleships, including two battleships; the opportunity proved perfect. The cruiser was eventually sunk in 1896 after she was both damaged and because she was incapable of dealing with her own missile fire. The Aretusa was preserved in the <unk> repository (merchant ship repositories).

LOR served on battleships of the Royal Navy, while she was refitted for troop transport duties. After her refit in 1921 she was taken over by the British and sunk off the coast of St. Lucia in August 1921. She would be laid up in the <unk> archives and never recommissioned. The LOR was lost in World War II when she was sunk by the German U-boat U-557 off Southampton. An equal number of Type IXB (refit) boats from the British Empire were also sunk by the U-boat.

As early as May 1912, the LOR was sent to the Southern Mediterranean by the British as part of their patrols to monitor activities at the Suez Canal. While there she acquired a measure of notoriety for her unusually big gun calibers. During one patrol she sank 6 German military craft before sinking one too. On June 13, 1912 she was sunk by the German U-boat U-410, the largest U-boat sunk in British waters that year. <unk> was salvaged from the bottom by the British after the war and continued as a Merchantman until 1969.

There were two ports on the main deck; forward, one to the left and aft, one to the right. An armillary sphere shielded the machinery areas from the sea. The turrets had two decks, with one in each side (intended to be used as a fire control platform). Two switches were used to close the fire control stations and signal to the gunners. The two forward-facing stanchions formed a convex spiral ridge at the top of the mast, up to the large picture ship.
