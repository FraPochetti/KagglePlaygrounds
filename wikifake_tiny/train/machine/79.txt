 Kitsune ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> : [ kitsu <unk> ne ] ) is the Japanese word for fox . Foxes are a common subject of Japanese folklore ; in English , kitsune refers to them in this context . Stories depict them as intelligent beings and as possessing magical abilities that increase with their age and wisdom . According to <unk> folklore , all foxes have the ability to shape shift into men or women .
The word シュシュカラ ( kushikaru ) also refers to the appearance of the fox, and sometimes to the body parts of a fox. For example, at the time of the inception of the second version of <unk> mythology, it was used as a common designation for humanoid foxes ( ) in the country's mythology.  So I don't think that this animal was invented after mythology.
