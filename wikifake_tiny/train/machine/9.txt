 The military history of Australia spans the nation 's 220 @-@ year modern history , from the early Australian frontier wars between <unk> and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 21st century . Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity , including the Anzac spirit . Some soldiers wear a bright orange ribbon, called the Anzac tin, on their uniform, which a few examples don't follow the tradition of other countries. For instance, Australia is the only nation in the world that adopted the paratrooper style of service, and many Australian military paratroopers marched to and from the field of battle during the Second World War. Some Australian military non-commissioned officers also wear a red badge that is symbolic of battle, after the battle of Gallipoli. After the removal of martial law in Queensland during the Second World War, many Australian army veterans were discharged from the army, receiving US veterans allowances. In many military occupational specialities, Australian army personnel tend to have higher average seniority and higher rank than that of the US army, as well as to hold less valuable postings, for instance, they take command of task forces outside of Asia, Africa or the Middle East, and the Australian army generally's seniority by an Australian degree and seniority by post. Australian army volunteers tend to be higher ranked and have higher pay, although often lower pay than in the US. In the 1970s, Australian military service was limited to one year at the overseas deployment area, and was then discharged to active duty for medical or other reasons. The next special service for the Australian military was service for 2 years as an unpaid staff member in a special forces unit in France and in a Joint Task Force, Australia (JTF-A). The JTF-A was disbanded in 2006. Throughout much of this time, there has been a decline in the number of Australian army personnel contributing to the military at home and abroad. In addition to regular Army personnel, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have an active recruiting programme, so that more men and women are given the opportunity to serve. Even though the Australians have fewer military members per capita, their contributions to the military are significant. From 1950 until 1990, as many as 6000 Australians served in Australia's defence forces, in addition to around 2,000 soldiers serving in Japan. There are over 10,000 members of the Australian Defence Force on active duty and overseas. The total number of Australians serving in the UK, Japan, Canada and the US is smaller than that of the Australian Defence Force, as there is no special Australian Defence Force. There are approximately 2,200 Australian reservists. Australian soldiers in the Foreign Army, with the exception of the RAF, serve in various units worldwide. Australian soldiers serving in the British Army are used for training purposes, rather than for the regular army. The recent drop in recruitment of active Australian military personnel is evident in the decline in their number and growth in the number of Australians who volunteer.
• Aug, 2006 update: Official Defence Department data shows that of the 2,372 Australian military personnel serving overseas at the end of June 2006, 23,105 had military roles abroad, and 100 active members of the Australian Defence Force were overseas.
• Feb 15, 2007 update: In 2006, 68 Australian military personnel (among them at least 39 on active duty) were killed in Afghanistan. The number of Australian troops killed since May 2001, have increased again to 101 (including 35 in 2005) with 185 injured (including 68 in 2006). In December 2006, 26 Australian troops and 3 of their Afghan counterparts died in the course of military operations in the country. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) are currently deployed to Afghanistan. Although the ADF have undergone massive changes since 2001, including an overhaul of combat capabilities and equipment, the prospect of Australian military personnel being deployed to Afghanistan seems unlikely. Despite the added personnel of the ADF in Iraq, Afghanistan is Australia's second most likely foreign destination, after Iraq.
• Jan 7, 2009 update: On 17 July 2007, a Joint Task Force, Australia ( JTF-A ) was disbanded.
• Aug 21, 2011 update: On 18 February 2012, Australia suspended cooperation with the US in responding to the Arak and Bala basins in Syria, after the US denied Australian special forces equipment and supplies for its air operations in the region, and the Australian government claimed that it "stands by" its previous military cooperation with the US in combating terrorism and protecting Australia's national interest in Afghanistan.
