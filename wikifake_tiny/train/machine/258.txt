ðŸ”¥ Eroding. Â At this point, before you say he hasn't changed a bit, get that speculation right. Chris Berry, producer of Aladdin Sane, even went so far as to say that Ozzy was doomed because Ozzy might have been the most popular thing in the world at that point. He's probably right. But wait, did he think Chris Snowy, Eddie Van Halen, and the other Rockettes were going to get these stars? They were all busy giving rock a bad name, while trying to make some cash.
ðŸ”¥ She wrote a song that leads to people dead. According to other contemporary accounts, though, Ozzy was really on the verge of death. And her song was, sadly, inspired by her feelings about him and everything around him. When her second marriage ended in 2000, she wrote a song called "Guilty All The Same" that actually led to her being jailed for illegal abortion (the song was initially placed on her album Homeward Bound and released that year). After the song, she changed her middle name to Holmes, and later told Rolling Stone she "had a bit of a mental breakdown because I wanted to give the world my own personal confession." This might be an indication that she really really wanted to give her "confession" to Ozzy. However, she went on to say that she "should never have published my own song". Yeah, fair enough. But it was on a Beatles & David Bowie album called Unsane that would later become to be called Be Your Own Pet, to Ozzy's career, and later to the mainstream music industry.
ðŸ”¥ Pre-breakup. Before Ozzy's death in 2002, apparently he and Rose could only talk for a couple of seconds at a time, even when they were living in the same house. This would be a whole new problem in our timeline. Most bands have a nice little honeymoon period, following a new born baby. The Beatles can even give it away by putting out a release called "One (Sheep) At A Time", which is done entirely by sheep. Most people would be happy to not have a new baby, so they don't break up. The only important thing is to be okay with having a baby every three years, or else you'll be broke pretty soon. Ozzy and Rose had not made it that long, and no one was prepared for this new show of how serious this life was going to be. "He knew it would be a struggle but that he was ready for it, for anybody who ever came after him," Jackie Coogan, R.E.M. (1987-1989)

âžŠ #7 Book. Remember when all the bands was coming up with the EPs? Well, the industry knew all about that. All the bands had to do was come up with something that is generally not heard in the American record industry, but which's being played on X-rated foreign imports. The industry was then doing everything it could to get it, but it was not being given that opportunity. Ozzy's was the wrong one. Rock & Roll Hall of Fame would act as a protective umbrella to protect the top selling record (music), while it was then continued to be sold in the rest of the world. And after it would all be completed, it would be up to the various partners, agents, and attorneys to look after their people. When Dave didn't choose to write his own narrative for it, nobody cared, because it would be over.
ðŸ”¥ Some products. There are no products that the mainstream press isn't willing to see make it to the stores. It is normal for the products to get an oversell by the year, which is the year before the next holiday. What is unusual is the idea that many of the products have little to no marketing in their titles. No products have a marketing campaign, as if to say that all the promotional teams will put their heads together and work together to solve the problem.
