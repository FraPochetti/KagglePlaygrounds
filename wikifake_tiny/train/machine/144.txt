 Fern Hobbs ( May 8 , 1883 â€“ April 10 , 1964 ) was an American attorney in the U.S. state of Oregon , and a private secretary to Oregon Governor Oswald West . She was noted for her ambition and several accomplishments as a young woman , and became the highest @-@ paid woman in public service in America in her mid @-@ twenties . 
 Hobbs made international news when Governor West sent her to implement martial law in the small Eastern Oregon town of Copperfield . Her reign ended on April 10, 1964, when she was shot and killed by the mayor of Portland. In truth, Hobbs was ill-prepared for the task. He had defeated the Cowichan Senate in 1881, and is old enough to have left Oregon in 1876 with his mother. Despite it being a difficult battle against a rabble of rural and corporate progressives, the legislature overrode the will of the citizens and decided not to allow her presence in the political arena. After 50 days of unhealed wounds, she passed away on April 10, 1964.
