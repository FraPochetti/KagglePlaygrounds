 State Route 243 ( SR 243 ) , or the Banning @-@ Idyllwild <unk> Highway , is a 30 @-@ mile ( 50 kilometer ) two @-@ lane highway that runs from Banning , California ( in the north ) to Idyllwild , California ( in the south ) in Riverside County , California . The highway is a connector between Interstate 10 ( I @-@ 10 ) and SR 74 . Along its route , it provides access to the San <unk> National Forest .
Where to park: The highway is accessed from Interstate 10 by southbound Route 245 ( Ca Hwy. 243 ) or eastbound Route 241 ( Ca Hwy. 243 ). The westbound exit from the Tuolumne <unk> Highway, and from the Interstate <unk> 10 bridge, are the only access points for visitors and bikers along the freeway.
Schedules: If you get off Interstate 10, take the Caltrans <unk> * Silver Cliffs <unk> exit and take the Highway 13 ( CA Highway 13 ) to the 50 mile mark of the freeway. If you are heading east or north on the California <unk> @-@ and I @-@ Cliffs, you should continue heading west.
If you get off I-10, take the Hwy. 115 (CA Highway 115 ) to the 60 mile mark. If you are heading west, take I-10 to the mile mark, and get on Route 14 ( CA Hwy. 14 ). Take the 30 degree left turn onto Hwy. 14, and follow the signposted highway to the freeway. If you get off I-10, keep going west (east) on Hwy. 13 (Ca Hwy. 13), and go west. Continue along Route 14 ( Ca Hwy. 14 ) to the California Highway 253 exit. At the exit for Route 14, make a left onto the open California Highway 253, or if you go north, take the CA Highway 24 ( Ca Highway 24 ) to the I-10 Exit 23 ( West Sacramento to American Fork ).
The upshot : The southern limit of the highway provides access to it from the Interstate <unk> 10 Bridge and from my cabin near the freeway.
Note: The most common reason for parking along the freeway is to get from where you are staying to where you are going to get food or groceries.
Tip : There are really only two ways to reach the airport : 1) take the Route 83 (I-83) to the Amador, Shasta, and Tuolumne Counties / U.S. Forest Service (at milepost 265) and then head south on Route 83. (There is also a nice public access off the freeway that runs south of the Interstate to the airport). Alternatively, you can head west out of the city and then go west on I-10. Just be aware that there are hills and businesses on both routes. (there is also a really nice access off the freeway that runs south of the Interstate to the airport). So, be sure to use the public access. I doubt many people will park along the highway, because I'll bet there is more money and things to do there. (although in the later stages of the trip, you will want to take some public buses to Idyllwild, CA. )
Note : I was a passenger in a plane that has stopped for fuel only one or two times in the past 20 years!
Current status : The highway was initially designated as a dual use roadway by the California Department of Transportation, before State of California politicians voted to change it to a one-way. Currently, a "Cash for Closures" fund has been set up by the New York City Department of Transportation. Whether or not the Highway is reopened or closed is the responsibility of the Department of Transportation.
