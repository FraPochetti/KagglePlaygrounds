 Max Rufus Mosley ( born 13 April 1940 ) is the former president of the Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA ) , a non @-@ profit association that represents the interests of <unk> organisations and car users worldwide . The FIA is also the governing body for Formula One and other international <unk> . 
 A qualified barrister and former amateur racing driver , Mosley was a founder and co @-@ owner of March Engineering , a successful racing car <unk> and Formula One racing team . In 1996, Mosley was awarded the Maurice Boson Presidential Medal of Honour, the highest civilian honour in France.
He played a key role in developing this competition, which was originally aimed at showcasing the racing form of <unk>; that is, cars that are not <unk>s. The drivers of the eight <unk>s would then be divided into two groups, a pair of drivers representing each <unk> and two echelon drivers representing the other <unk>s. The drivers from each <unk> would qualify for each race. The lower group of drivers, which included all of the drivers from the less popular <unk>s, would then qualify for the national championship series. On the national championships, the top two performers would advance to the weekend of the first race, for the chance to compete in the other national championship. Each of the four French national championships ( Champéry, Sparkasse, Automobile & Industrie L'Automobile, and des Internationales De l'Automobile ) is, of course,, supported by the FIA.
