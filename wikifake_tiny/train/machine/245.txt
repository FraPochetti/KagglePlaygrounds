 The Food Album is a compilation album by American singer @-@ songwriter " Weird Al " Yankovic , released on June 22 , 1993 by Scotti Brothers Records . The release features ten of Yankovic 's song parodies , all of which <unk> to food . A similar album , The TV Album , which features songs entirely about television , would be released two years later . 
 The album was begrudgingly released by Yankovic , who felt that the compilation was unnecessary and merely a way for his record label to make money . 
Many collectors do find The Food Album to be an interesting find. Many of them actually like it, but many others don't. I recommend it only for collectors who truly appreciate Yankovic's voice and appreciation of the English language. It should be noted that it has been surpassed by its steaming crazy successor, the Food Album 2 (also by Yankovic ). In it, Yankovic channels all his long-ago Yankovitchian hunger for food, demonstrating just how much he will eat to sustain the drive. The Food Album 2, especially, is an homage to My Neighbor Totoro (another weird book by surrealist writer Yoshinori Kitase ), revealing an even darker side to the kindly cartoonish Yankovic.
