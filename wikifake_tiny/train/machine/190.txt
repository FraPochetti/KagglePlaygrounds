Two, the first, is the saga of the Nemedhcól, or Guardian of the Boats, of whom Bioggí mBó was the first. And the second is mentioned of the Nemedhcól by the monk Thomas, of Lugh Durchhon (d. 1074), who says that there is now a nest, or high place, in his 'hope'. This centre in the island is called 'Faisthán'.
