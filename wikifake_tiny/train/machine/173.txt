 Somerset 's first match of the 2009 NatWest Pro40 , against Nottinghamshire , ended just one over short of the requirement for a match . 
Contained within the back pages of the official match day programme is the full play by play of the match. 
A season's worth of analysis was buried in the pages, making for a short document with some plenty of meaningless text but to those who are serious about the game, this is the best information that will ever be released.
