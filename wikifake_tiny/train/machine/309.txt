 SM U @-@ 3 or U @-@ III was the lead boat of the U @-@ 3 class of submarines or U @-@ boats built for and operated by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( German : <unk> und <unk> Kriegsmarine or <unk> Kriegsmarine ) before and during the First World War . The submarine was built as part of a plan to evaluate foreign submarine designs , and was built by Germaniawerft of Kiel , Germany . By virtue of the result of the decision to build for the Austro @-@ 3 class, the interest of the German submarine industry in the country had always been reduced, and after the war it became the responsibility of the company to rebuild the country (the diesel submarines, the therekt, the E-boat ones, the Scheldt, the Graf. U E ) and the German submarine industry to repossess boats built for the German Navy or those which might serve the German Navy of Austria. There was a significant prospect in which the submarines of the firstclass of the Austro @-@ 3 class would serve for either the U. S. Navy or the U. K. Navy. The concept of the sub was derived from German submarine designs known as Bismarck, and it was based on the torpedoes of the high explosive, barrel nacelle. It was actually a high explosive cruise torpedo (HEP-13), and had a very very large hole in the stem. As the name implies, this system was used by the German Navy to sink their opponent's ship in a complex acoustical system. While smaller ships like the destroyer and the submarine were equipped with gas turbines, the German Submarine Bureau planned to equip the main units with a hydrofoil which could produce the same effect as for an HEP-13. This system made the sub to be similar to a submarine of today, but capable of carrying tons of bombs. Because the original Bismarck sank the British Sovereign, the German sub was required to escort the British Royal Navy at all times. The designation U E had a larger role, but it was to keep the ships of the German Navy of Austria for a long time. Also because it was created with the need for excellent deep water protection, the U E included h.m. and h.s. tanks to repel a German torpedo attack. The U E also performed anti-submarine patrols with the Klasse the "whale boat" (with a lantern for night patrols ).
