 
 = M @-@ 114 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 
 M @-@ 114 was the designation of a former state trunkline highway and planned <unk> in the US state of Michigan around the city of Grand Rapids . It was designated by the end of 1929 on various streets in adjoining cities and townships . By the 1940s , sections of it on the west and south sides of Grand Rapids were given new designations and the segment along the east side of town was finished . The 40-foot-wide roadway was named the US 91 Branch from the main US 91 junction on Michigan 13 north, later to become Interstate 94. As the east half of the US 91 Branch on Michigan 13 was taken off the highway, the spur was renamed Interstate 94. In September 2009, through the acronym "M 0 M", US 91 was extended from Merrill St. in Marquette to I-94 north. This extension completed the terminus for the spur as Michigan 10 in Northfield, MN is now I-94.  (source : Michigan Department of Transportation website )
M 0 M @-@ 114 and the westbound end of Michigan 10.  M 0 M M had Interstate 94's final design.  It was seen from mile marker 45 on the north side of the ramp on the extended I-94 and no vehicle was allowed to enter until it was felt a tow was not necessary. The bridge at Interstates 94 and 94a remained open until 1941 when the 1 and 1A bridges were replaced with a new interstate bridge that is 10 feet higher than the old I-94s: Interstate 90. This was the span where the tolls were imposed and rebuilt at I-94 and I-94a. The tolls were waived on a section of Interstates 94 in the early 1960s after the Securicor-funded Interstate 94 Toll Bridge replaced the old bridge. The extension began construction in May 1961 and continued through to the end of 1962. The Interstate 91 cut off between Mallersport and Martinsville was rebuilt into the highway (note that the Mallersport bridge span was also repaired by the USA-California High Speed Train ) during this time. One thing to note is that in both the I-91 to I-94 overpasses, (24.3 and 35.5 miles, respectively), the mallards on the bottom are the same as they are on the modern roads.  It is also possible that the I-91 bridges crossed the old ones on the interstate between the west side of the old bridge to the south of the new one.
A few photos of a closure of I-94 on Detroit's south side. These were from 2013. While many believe that the bridge over I-94 was made a state-sponsored feature because of the toll payments, the tolled roadway did not afford an element of luxury in the early 1950s. Cars did not always have engine bay space to allow for sidecars or luggage. Some of these things were a blessing and others an aggravation. With no room for motorhomes or buses, most travelers were stuck behind an empty traffic lane. It was not uncommon to hear all ages, languages and dialects living in the same car or in one adjacent car. Below is a photo taken in 1966 showing many drivers and some of the cars.

Above, in the side-by-side a 1958 Ford pick-up and four-door truck are seen on the shoulder of I-94. They are said to be the original family.
So, what's new? As I am sure you are aware, the Grand Rapids City Council approved a $100 million plan to build a new convention center on the Northside. This is a previously planned highway extension that was never completed and I have been critical of the funding process of the project in the past. I want to express my respect for the financial commitment to fund the new facility. Unfortunately, the DOT was unable to meet the deadline by which the concept for a convention center was to be 100% complete. However, the effort to replace the White River bridge will begin later this year and the new I-94 at the interchange with Interstate 94, and possibly two other developments in the Southside are on track to get underway in the next few years. There are other plans afoot for the Southside to incorporate the Eastside Expressway into a north-south quadrangle as an interchange where new interstate links with I-94 would be constructed,  as well as the possible future creation of a route by which I-94 can be extended further. I'd like to close with an interesting situation that happened recently.
