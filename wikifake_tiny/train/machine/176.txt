 " Mothers of the Disappeared " is a song by rock band U2 . It is the eleventh and final track on their 1987 album The Joshua Tree . The song was inspired by lead singer Bono 's experiences in Nicaragua and El Salvador in July 1986 , following U2 's involvement on Amnesty International 's A <unk> of Hope tour . He learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo , a group of women whose children had been " disappeared " by the Argentine and Chilean dictatorships . The first singer to make a connection between A <unk> of Hope and the disappearance of children was Melody Maker, a Canadian singer and guitarist. Bono said that this was her " first report and it was so good." He later explained: "It really felt like I was getting with the revolution because it felt like a real issue. All this violence, killing and oppression and no one is asking for it. So, this is what it feels like." Many bands during the 1980s contributed music to the song'Mothers of the Disappeared '. The full music video was made by film director Malcolm E. Brown.
