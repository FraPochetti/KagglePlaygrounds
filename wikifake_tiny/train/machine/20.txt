<unk> is a rare storm in the eastern Atlantic (named after the general area around which the winds of <unk> tended to develop), and <unk> is quite a rare storm in the western Atlantic (named after the bay where <unk> developed).  Most of the storms of the western Atlantic that have been named for the area surrounding <unk> occur within several hundred miles of <unk>.
The first <unk> was formed between June 5 and 6, 2004 in the North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico.  The storm created 1.5 million tons of rain, causing a dire drought in certain areas.  <unk> finally formed  between September 14, 2004 and September 26, 2006, and its impact on the Earth was devastating.  Although it was a minor hurricane, Hurricane Andrew of 1976 generated by Tropical Depression 7 ( hurricane ) caused nearly $1.4 billion in damages (2004, figure 4), and Hurricane Wilma of 2005, the third hurricane in the list (in 2005, figure 5), nearly $1.8 billion (2004).
The previous is name (with its last letter) is still on the list with <unk> named as a minor hurricane in 2007. <unk> formed on June 5, 2007 near the Prince Edward Islands, but  created no new rain. <unk> strengthened and reached hurricane status on June 13, while experiencing two of its largest downpours in recorded history.  The storm's maximum sustained winds were a mighty 90 mph (150 km/ h ) during its final day of production and it caused a long list of damages in parts of the British Virgin Islands, northernmost Puerto Rico, and southwestern Florida.  <unk> was nearly twice as powerful as Hurricane Andrew and wind gusts of over 200 mph (322 km/ h).  <unk> is thought to be the strongest storm in recorded hurricane history, although <unk> is well behind Andrew in terms of its destructive potential.
<unk> is predicted to re-emerge in the Atlantic as an extremely strong tropical storm next week.
