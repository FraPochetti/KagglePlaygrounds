 Islais Creek or Islais Creek Channel ( previously known as Du <unk> Creek , Islais Channel and Islais Swamp ) is a small creek in San Francisco , California . The name of the creek is derived from a <unk> Native American word " <unk> " or " <unk> " , the name for the <unk> <unk> wild cherries . Around the time of the Gold Rush , the area became an industrial hub , and the condition of the creek worsened . After the devastating earthquake in 1906 , the city decided to reclaim the creek using earthquake debris , reducing the <unk> to its present size . Though much of Islais Creek has been converted to an underground culvert , remnants still exist today at both Glen Canyon Park and Third Street . Several community organizations are dedicated to preserve these remnants , as they are important wildlife habitats .

 The historic Islais Creek , the largest body of water in the city covering an area of nearly 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 7 @.@ <unk> sq mi ; 20 @.@ 234 km2 ) , had two main branches . One originated near the southern slope of Twin <unk> , slightly north of <unk> Drive . It flowed downstream southeastward through the Glen Canyon Park <unk> Bosworth Street and eventually reaching the bottom of the Mission Street viaduct at I @-@ 280 . The other branch began at the intersection of Cayuga Avenue and Regent Street . It flowed generally eastward along Mission Street and reached the I @-@ 280 viaduct . Together , as a wider creek , it ran parallel to <unk> Boulevard and I @-@ 280 and emptied into the Islais Creek estuary , near Industrial Street and <unk> Avenue . <unk> Creek , a nearby creek that originated from <unk> Valley , also joined Islais Creek at the César <unk> Boulevard and Evans Avenue intersection . 
 From its sources in the Glen Canyon , the entire creek stretched about 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) to the San Francisco Bay . The mouth was nearly 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) wide , providing up to 85 % of the drinking water in San Francisco . Due to urban development , however , the watershed of Islais Creek has been reduced by roughly 80 % from its historical extent . A large number of neighborhoods in San Francisco today , such as <unk> Heights , Hunters Point , <unk> Valley , parts of the Mission and <unk> Hill , was once covered by the extent of the creek . 
 In 2007 , the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission , which manages the city 's water , began investigating the possibility of " <unk> " underground portions of the creek . As of 2009 , remnants of the creek remain inside the Glen Canyon Park and a 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) channel near Third Street where Islais Creek emptied into the bay .

 The history of Islais Creek dates to the 18th century . The name Los Islais first appeared on Mexican maps in 1834 , named for the Islay cherries that grew wildly in the area . By 1850 , water from the creek was used by farmers to <unk> crops . The Gold Rush marked the decline of the creek as large numbers of gold rushers <unk> into the city . 
 A railroad <unk> was built over the creek and <unk> flats in the 1860s and in a lawsuit that went up to the California Supreme Court called The People of the State of California ex <unk> The Board of State Harbor Commissioners <unk> . The <unk> And Bay View Railroad Company , Islais Creek was declared a non @-@ navigable waterway in 1883 . 
 In 1871 , the area along the creek became known as the city ’ s " New <unk> " when more than 100 <unk> opened . Since then , the condition of the creek deteriorated , literally becoming a dumping place of garbage , sewage , animal waste , and <unk> meat products . The condition became so bad that the creek was commonly referred to as " <unk> Creek " by San Franciscans , according to historian Karl <unk> . 
 After the 1906 earthquake , San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to fill the creek with earthquake debris , reducing the creek to its present size . During World War II , it served as <unk> areas for large ocean @-@ going <unk> . The area also located the largest <unk> <unk> processing plant in the United States West Coast . In fact , the abandoned five @-@ story high <unk> crane , used to transport large amount of <unk> from ships to the plant as late as 1974 , still remains on the creek bank preserved as a historic landmark .
