 Oribi ( pronounced / <unk> / ) ( <unk> ourebi ) is a small antelope found in eastern , southern and western Africa . The sole member of its genus , the oribi was first described by the German zoologist <unk> August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1782 . Eight subspecies are identified . The oribi reaches nearly 50 – 67 centimetres ( 20 – 26 in ) at the shoulder and weighs 12 – 22 kilograms ( 26 – 49 lb ) . This antelope features a slightly raised back , and long neck and limbs . The glossy , yellowish to rufous brown coat contrasts with the white chin , throat , underparts and rump . Only males possess horns ; the thin , straight horns , 8 – 18 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 1 in ) long , are smooth at the tips and ringed at the base . 
 Typically diurnal , the oribi is active mainly during the day . Small herds of up to four members are common ; males defend their group 's territory , 25 – 100 hectares ( 62 – 247 acres ) large . The oribi is primarily a <unk> , and prefers fresh grasses and <unk> occasionally . A seasonal breeder , the time when mating occurs varies geographically . Unlike all other small antelopes , oribi can exhibit three types of mating systems , depending on the habitat – <unk> , polygyny and <unk> . Gestation lasts for six to seven months , following which a single calf is born ; births peak from November to December in southern Africa . <unk> takes place at four to five months . 
 The oribi occurs in a variety of habitats – from <unk> , floodplains and tropical grasslands with 10 – 100 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 – 39 @.@ 4 in ) tall grasses to <unk> grasslands at low altitudes , up to 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) above the sea level . This antelope is highly sporadic in distribution , ranging from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east and southward to Angola and the Eastern Cape ( South Africa ) . The oribi has been classified as Least Concern by the IUCN ; numbers have declined due to agricultural expansion and competition from livestock .

 The scientific name of the oribi is <unk> ourebi . The sole member of its genus , the oribi is placed under the family <unk> . The species was first described by the German zoologist <unk> August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1782 . The oribi was formerly included in the tribe <unk> , that comprised a variety of other dwarf antelopes , including <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> . In 1963 , German <unk> Theodor <unk> separated the oribi and <unk> into a new tribe , <unk> ; later on , zoologist Jonathan <unk> assigned the oribi to <unk> , a tribe of its own . The common name " oribi " ( pronounced / <unk> / ) comes from the <unk> name for the animal , <unk> . 
 In a revision of the phylogeny of the tribe <unk> on the basis of nuclear and mitochondrial data in 2013 , Eva <unk> <unk> ( of the University of Cambridge ) and colleagues showed that the oribi is the sister taxon to all other <unk> . The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study . 
 The following eight subspecies are identified : 
 Of these , <unk> Colin Groves and Peter <unk> identify O. o. hastata , O. o. <unk> , O. o. ourebi and O. o. <unk> as independent species in their 2011 publication <unk> Taxonomy .
