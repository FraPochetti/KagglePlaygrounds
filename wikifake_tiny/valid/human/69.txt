 Mycena galericulata is a mushroom species commonly known as the common bonnet , the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> @-@ gill fairy helmet . The type species of the genus Mycena was first described scientifically in 1772 , but was not considered a Mycena until 1821 . It is quite variable in color , size , and shape , which makes it somewhat difficult to reliably identify in the field . The mushrooms have caps with distinct radial grooves , particularly at the margin . The cap 's color varies from grayish @-@ brown to dark brown and the shape ranges from bell @-@ like to <unk> conical to flattened with an umbo . The stem is hollow , white , tough and thin , without a ring and often roots deeply into the wood on which it grows . The gills are white to grayish or even pinkish when mature and are connected by distinct cross @-@ veins . The caps can reach 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) in diameter , and have a <unk> odor and taste . The spore print is white and the gills are pink at maturity , which can lead to possible confusion with species of the <unk> genus . M. galericulata mushrooms grow mostly in clusters on the well @-@ decayed stumps of deciduous and coniferous trees from spring to autumn . The species can generally be considered inedible . It is common and widespread in the entire temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere , but it has also been reported from Africa .

 The fungus was first described scientifically as Agaricus <unk> by Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio <unk> in 1772 , and sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1821 Systema <unk> . That same year , Samuel Frederick Gray transferred the species to the genus Mycena . <unk> for the species include Agaricus <unk> named by William Hudson in 1778 , Agaricus <unk> described by August Johann Georg Karl <unk> in 1893 , <unk> <unk> by Franklin Sumner <unk> in 1909 , and <unk> <unk> by William <unk> <unk> in 1916 . 
 Mycena galericulata is the type species of the genus Mycena . It is classified in section Mycena of Mycena in the <unk> scheme of Rudolph Arnold <unk> <unk> . In the older ( 1947 ) classification of Alexander H. Smith , he placed it in the subgenus <unk> , section <unk> — " a most <unk> series of blackish , brown , gray , bluish @-@ gray , or brownish @-@ gray species mostly with ascending gills and generally large to moderate stature . " 
 The specific epithet galericulata is derived from the Latin <unk> , and means " with a small hat " . Gray called it the " <unk> high @-@ stool " . It is commonly known as the " common bonnet " , the " <unk> <unk> " , or the " <unk> @-@ gill fairy helmet " .

 The cap of M. galericulata is roughly conical when young , and eventually becomes broadly bell @-@ shaped or with a broad umbo that can reach diameters of 2 – 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) . The cap margin is initially somewhat curved inward , but soon <unk> out or even becomes <unk> , and often splits <unk> in age . The surface has radial grooves that extend nearly to the center , and feels <unk> but not sticky . The color is somewhat buff @-@ brown on the margin , and fades gradually to pale dirty tan to dirty <unk> @-@ brown . The flesh is thick in the center of the cap and tapers evenly to the margin , and is watery gray , with a cartilage @-@ like texture . The odor and taste are <unk> to strongly farinaceous ( similar to the smell of <unk> ground flour ) , to <unk> @-@ like . 
 The gills are narrowly attached ( <unk> ) to broadly attached or <unk> . The gill spacing ranges from close to somewhat distantly spaced , with 26 – 36 gills reaching the stem ; there are additionally three or four tiers of <unk> ( short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stem ) .
