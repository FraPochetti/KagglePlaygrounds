 WASP @-@ 44 is a G @-@ type star in constellation <unk> that has the Jupiter @-@ size planet WASP @-@ 44b in orbit . The star is slightly less massive and slightly smaller than the Sun ; it is also slightly cooler , but is more metal @-@ rich . The star was observed by SuperWASP , an organization in search of planets , starting in 2009 ; manual follow @-@ up observations used WASP @-@ 44 's spectrum and measurements of its radial velocity led to the discovery of the transiting planet WASP @-@ 44b . The planet and its star were presented along with WASP @-@ <unk> and WASP @-@ <unk> on May 17 , 2011 by a team of scientists testing the idea that Hot Jupiters tend to have circular orbits , an assumption that is made when the orbital <unk> of such planets are not well @-@ constrained .

 WASP @-@ 44 was observed between July and November 2009 by the WASP @-@ South , a station of the SuperWASP planet @-@ searching program based at the South African Astronomical Observatory . Observations of the star revealed a periodic decrease in its brightness . WASP @-@ South , along with the SuperWASP @-@ North station at the <unk> de los <unk> Observatory on the Canary Islands , collected 15 @,@ <unk> photometric observations , allowing scientists to produce a more accurate light curve . Another set of observations yielded a 6 @,@ 000 point photometric data set , but the light curve was prepared late and was not considered in the discovery paper . 
 In 2010 , a European science team investigated the star using the <unk> spectrograph and collected seventeen spectra of WASP @-@ 44 . From the spectra , radial velocity measurements were <unk> . Analysis of collected <unk> data ruled out the possibility that the detected radial velocity was caused by the blended spectrum of a spectroscopic binary star , supporting the possibility that the body orbiting WASP @-@ 44 was indeed a planet , designated WASP @-@ 44b . 
 The <unk> <unk> Telescope at La <unk> Observatory in Chile was used to follow up on the discovery <unk> WASP @-@ 44 , searching for a point at which the planet <unk> , or crossed in front of , its host star . One transit was detected .
