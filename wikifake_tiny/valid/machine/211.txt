 The Réunion ibis or Réunion sacred ibis ( <unk> solitarius ) is an extinct species of ibis that was endemic to the volcanic island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean . The first subfossil remains were found in 1974 , and the ibis was first scientifically described in 1987 . Its closest relatives are the <unk> sacred ibis , the African sacred ibis , and the straw @-@ necked ibis . The ibis is an island-dwelling arboreal herbivore, with a long legged, wiry build, unique for its yellowish brown color and long slender body and tail. It is a marsupial and is a member of the (numerous) circine family. Common subspecies include the (numerous) North and South American super-alert ibis ( Sturnus terrestris ), the little shawl-necked ibis ( Sturnus sturni ), the suvannoline ibis ( Struthionus ciliatus ), and the (numerous) unusual rosette-eared ibis ( Sturnus pennsylvanicus ). The birds of the same subfamily, the North American white ibis (sturnus robinsoni), are also distinguished by the prominent red beak, curling wings, and a comparatively short lower and upper beak. The grey-crowned, falcon-headed white ibis ( Sturnus mercenarius ) is the smallest of the species, and its rosette-eared and occasionally lanky, shrub-bodied brethren, the (numerous) true-coloured ibis ( Sturnus australis ), and (numerous) bush-red, chestnut-lipped, woolly-tailed ewes ( Alocasia erisei ) are similar in appearance. Both of these species are extensively hunted as game, especially for their meat. These birds are found throughout the eastern Caribbean, in the eastern New World, and in the north of India.
