 Islais Creek or Islais Creek Channel ( previously known as Du <unk> Creek , Islais Channel and Islais Swamp ) is a small creek in San Francisco , California . The name of the creek is derived from a <unk> Native American word " <unk> " or " <unk> " , the name for the <unk> <unk> wild cherries . Around the time of the Gold Rush , the area became an industrial hub , and the condition of the creek worsened . The spring near the dam was a natural, green stream, but due to its use as an industrial dump and the development of the bay region, it was mostly gone by the 1870s. By then the creek had turned into a freshwater estuary, only making its way into the bay. The wetland the creek runs through was a relatively stable one, until the area was flooded in the 1882 Loma Prieta earthquake. At the time, the creek fed the stream that ran downstream of the dam, but today the Spring is a place where the streams runs dry. But there is plenty of room in the area where there is nothing to prevent you from coming onto the Spring.
Lola Prieta is the former name for the Spring. The grand old man's old home has been restored into a Historic and Architectural Park and has restored the historic image of the Spring and Islais Creek. The Spring has been restricted to property owners and trespassers.
Note that the adjacent Aosta Creek that begins from the path has been the site of a historic forest fire in the winter of 2011.
The vast upper and middle section of Islais Creek has always been dry because of the land base erosion and a previous formation of gravel rocks, and the flood waters removed the area to a land base sediment foundation, which is now protected in part from future flood mitigation efforts. It is evident that the larger part of the stream is now completely dry, and in fact it is still dry for much of the first part of the year. The bottom portion of the stream is still a bare swamp because of the conservation efforts. The actual depth of the water in the Spring is about 40 feet, and if you float down below the floodwaters, you can see the actual bottom of the stream. However, the area is often not as dry as it seems because the floodwaters werehes the sand into the area. In some areas the sand is very deep, so the water is so deep it can sink down to the bottom of the Spring.
To answer some questions on my personal experience on the Spring, I will summarize my understanding of what happened. I live on the far eastern end of the Bay Area from the water, and have been to the Bay and the Bay Area three times on vacation. This experience was actually not just a downpour, but had some of the driest water I have ever had. As I mentioned before, the low water on the east side of the bay was surprisingly warm in the middle part of the day and the high water on the west side was about 25 degrees. It was obvious that the water that was high in the middle was very warm, even though it was drier on the east side. It is unclear whether the water was dry because of the warm conditions or what drove up the levels. My first impression was that the water was probably more than 24 degrees warm, which had a very different feeling than the low that I had experienced at three different points in the Bay. My second impression was that it probably was more like 29 or 30 degrees warm, which was really kind of hot. A third impression was that it was kind of cold as well, but I don't think that any of them was very uncommon for places in San Francisco. My first impression was that it wasn't an especially beautiful place, and a third was that I don't know enough about the whole ecology of the bay area to make a judgment on the particular species of birds that live in the Spring.
A 4-wheel drive through the creek in the field. This is where you get to see the occasional animal walker or jogger, but that is about it. There are very few waterfowl or other animal visitors to the Spring. I did hear that there were many crabs and fish, but I am pretty sure that most of the crabs and fish were being eaten by chickens that were drinking from the spring water, which meant that it was not a great place to be crabbing.
These days I take most of my fishing off the Bay Area with the exception of my one trip to the Bay Area every few years, as my fishing is a bit more creative. Today, when I don't have my 4WD and no filter, I am more successful in fishing for trout and bass.
