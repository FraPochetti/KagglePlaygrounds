She joined the military and served as an assistant pilot with the Aircraft Engineering School at Valencia, as well as a pilot in a Vickers Aircraft Company. It was during her years of flying with the military that her heart sank with the prospects of becoming a woman.

Later life

In the years that followed, she spent time and money travelling from country to country to earn money for her art. She published a number of artistic and political publications, sometimes disguised as religious tracts, such as Woman Religious Propaganda, The Mystique of Maggiore, and Have The Christ At Night. 

She moved to Italy to live with Elisabetta Anastasia Morano, an Italian Roma and a prominent Italian neo-nazi. María Eva Perón obtained Italian citizenship and remained in Italy, raising the family with the help of her next-door neighbour, María Taracol, with whom she had several daughters.

Among her first duties was marrying a member of the military staff, later confirmed to be her father-in-law, Manuel López González. An attempt by María Eva to marry a Protestant clergyman failed, and so she continued her political activity by trying to influence politicians, including Luis Inés Banderas, the then president of Argentina, and Fernandez. María Eva was also known for her artistic ability, working with trompe l'oeil paintings, sculptures, and mosaic tiles.

In 1979, María Eva met her final love, Fernando José Velasco Arraez, a businessman, who became her life partner. Together, they became the first same-sex couple in Argentina to be recognized by the press. Unfortunately, this was not to be their last long-term partnership; Fernando José died in 1984, leaving María Eva with her second husband, Juan José Perón, a poet who continued to work on his neo-fascist, anticolonial, communist, neo-fascist political platform until his death in 1992.
