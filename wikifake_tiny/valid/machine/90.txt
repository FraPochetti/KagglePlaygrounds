 Tropical Storm Abby was an exceptionally small tropical cyclone that had minor effects across Southeast Texas in early August 1964 . Forming as a tropical depression out of a trough south of Louisiana on August 5 , the system moved generally westward . It was not until August 7 that the system began to organize . That day , an eye rapidly formed within the system and it became a tropical storm just 60 mi ( 95 km ) southeast of Galveston , Texas . The presence of the eye suggested that we were beginning to see two large tropical cyclones forming together. This rapidly formed eye was the center of a tropical storm which would become Abby ( to the southeast ). The eye would pass by and then later return to its usual position south of Galveston on August 10. The intensity and area of the cyclone could not be determined, as it is now considered a point-source.
Abby was very large, with a surface wind speed of 53 mph (92 km/h) at 3 p.m. local time, which was twice the average for this time period and nearly 10 mph (15 km/h) above the average for August. The most significant impacts of this system were on Louisiana, where it created floods and additional flash flood damage.
" It will increase the difficulty in evaluating the progress of the only cyclone this year that has actually been designated by the National Hurricane Center as a tropical cyclone. The system has a periodical periodicity (more or less) and is typically somewhat more intense than an average tropical cyclone (usually ). The intensity of Tropical Storm Abby, relative to that of past years, is at least 150 times greater than any other such storm in the Atlantic basin.", Karen Hilker, Science and Environmental Policy, Vol. 5, No. 6, pg. 731,
Ocean Base Radar (OBR) images from NOAA's weather satellite MODIS and Tropical Ocean Radar Suite reveal that the cyclone, called Tropical Storm Abby (LHD9), formed on or about August 5, although the cyclone is still out at sea and still forecast to become a tropical storm on August 9.
Deborah Kelley from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported the eye was 17.6 miles (27.3 km) wide and that the storm system was near low pressure and as high as 27.9-28.7 miles (45.8-47.8 km) above the mean sea level.
By all indications, this cyclone was going to develop as a tropical cyclone, but it is currently still being observed as a point-source tropical cyclone, just as is tropical cyclone Adam (CA64), which is forecast to become a tropical depression on Monday.
There were no tropical cyclones or tropical depressions as of Wednesday morning, October 3, as the tropical cyclone was the result of a strong ridge in the stratosphere.
" The late morning weather pattern delivered several mixed weather patterns and produced several scattered tropical low pressure systems, with locations being south of 66 degrees East (Somerville), southern Texas, and south of 70 degrees West (Esmond) and as far west as Laredo, Texas. This condition continued through late morning as the ridge began to dissipate. The earliest high level low was an initial area about 70 miles (113 km) from Laredo and continuing eastward near 66.5 degrees East (Somerville). Between about 5 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. Laredo was down to at least 40 degrees East (TBD) and just east of 64 degrees East (Somerville).
We have very little information about tropical cyclone development in the higher latitudes of the troposphere, where most of the intense storms are formed, so Tropical Storm Abby was quite unusual in that it was never associated with the equatorial regions, and had a tropical boundary at very low elevation (over 70 miles (113 km) low.)
The hurricane hit at 5:38 a.m. central time in Seguin, Texas, where it was 124 miles (201 km) southeast of the city of Point Beaumont. It went on to establish a hurricane center east of Seguin, but that area is in a swath from around 66 miles (135 km) southwest to near 80 miles (130 km) southeast of Seguin, with normal NSL development to the southwest. The storm was 26 miles (42 km) west of the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, and west of Corpus Christi, Texas. A few hours later, the system moved westward to become Tropical Storm Abbie ( LHD7), and it would then remain under a tropical storm at 5 p.m. central time.
Storm energy from the storm reached Houston just before 8 p.m.
