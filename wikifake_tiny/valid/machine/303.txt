Erving Goffman
One of the more complete discussions of the sociological concept of social justice. Though Erving was perhaps most famous for drawing attention to the roots of social injustice and economic exploitation, his best known work involved thinking about how society builds and manages culture and institutions to foster respect and security for all. Although his more sanguine (and scholarly) take on the origins of the profit-driven capitalism of the American past still hangs over much of his work, it should be noted that he was one of the earliest to argue that moral  principles, such as justice, fairness, integrity, and equality, are strongly connected to collective interests, and this goes beyond justifying individual selfish acts (such as discrimination and social justice). His views on these kinds of social justice were "avowedly Marxist", rather than "the postmodern liberalism he later became".

E. G.  Goffman (1927–2008) was a leading member of the controversial 'Third Way' of American politics from the 1940s to the 1970s. 
The 'Third Way' was not entirely the result of the struggles of an ideologue; it was also the result of the politics of the mainstream of American politics from the 1940s to the 1970s. Although it came out of early Third World immigration politics, it was raised by many everyday Americans and advocates of Third World immigration and was associated with a demand to rein in the growing power of the multinational corporations of the Ford/Chrysler and General Motors interests, and the growing anti-colonialist stance of the far left and radical traditional American liberals. Its ideology was really the opposite of everything modern, modernist, left, communist, or socialist about the nation-state.

Drawing on a tradition of philosophical theorizing on the origins of society, practices, and goals that had shaped the history of anthropology (and much of other academic disciplines), modernists argued that the state is ultimately the psychological, social, and political institution through which social and political systems are shaped. The presence of man in society is seen as a direct product of his status and status criteria; his economic status, capacity for work, the means of subsistence, ability to reproduce, ability to acquire wealth, freedom to do the things he needs to survive, his affiliations with other individuals, what he is capable of enjoying or fear that he will be overwhelmed by—all this enables him to make his own kind of choices. Thus, the rule of man is conceived of as a set of rules governing the limits of human possibilities in their relationship with nature, and the mechanisms by which they affect the natural environment. For the neoliberals, the state is not merely a tool for the acquisition of material goods, but rather its very existence, even its very existence as the result of the human activity of statesmen and society at large. The deregulated freedom of individual agents and choice that the state brings about is often understood in terms of freedom of choice to resist temptation, to have her work paid for, and to allow for and even support extramarital sexual relations (once they are out of wedlock). It is interpreted as an absence of pressure for sex education that is considered healthy and compatible with the loss of 'honor' that comes with a marriage.... The comparative study of social injustice is deeply entangled with the study of mechanisms of influence on institutions and the social choices of individual persons. Public policy is usually characterized as a bundle of decisions, often biased or overlapping, that are influenced by social factors. Of course, the study of social injustice and its social mechanisms is not and cannot be conducted solely through comparative historical methodology; rather, the relationship between theory and practice is highly complex and multi-faceted. The comparative study of social injustice thus presupposes a way of thinking about the study of theory that develops precisely the kinds of distinctions that are implicit in the study of the study of social phenomena.
