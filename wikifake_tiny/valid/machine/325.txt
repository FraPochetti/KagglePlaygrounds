On the Night of the Concert, the band brought a 5-tonne barrow on a flatbed truck. After collecting stones to repair their barricades, and two large sacks of dirt to protect themselves from water hoses, they were treated to a spectacular set of performances by the regional alternative orchestra, Razme, in Sarajevo, with comedian Tom Adams performing on the street behind the main stage. The ZHU performers went on to win a Grammy Award for 'Best Experimental Music', and first at the Elektric' festival in Sofia in 1995, and then at the Festival Eurovision in Bratislava in 1996.. The U2 concerts in Sarajevo were conducted by Baroness Berlaymont of the World Services and TV Commission, acting as a liaison to both the local newspaper'Sarajevo'and the Italian Foreign Ministry. The band returned to Sarajevo the following year to host 'Bosnian Jazz', a tournament. ~ Â  Baroness Berlaymont < berlaymont@optonline.
