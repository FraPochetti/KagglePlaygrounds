 WASP @-@ 44 is a G @-@ type star in constellation <unk> that has the Jupiter @-@ size planet WASP @-@ 44b in orbit . The star is slightly less massive and slightly smaller than the Sun ; it is also slightly cooler , but is more metal @-@ rich . The star was observed by SuperWASP , an organization in search of planets , starting in 2009 ; manual follow @-@ up observations used WASP @-@ 44 's spectrum and measurements of its radial velocity led to the discovery of the transiting planet WASP @-@ 44b . The planet was detected in 2015 by SSA @-@ 5962 c. The inner 3 pc of the planet's orbit is 0.17 AU across, giving a radius of about 0.3 AU. The planet orbits Jupiter at a distance of about 13 kpc and has a mean orbit period of about 60 days. The surface temperature is about 0 Â°C. Observations of WASP @-@ 44b were at VLT @-@ 1374 fw, and such precise timing allowed post astro @-@ observations were done using it. The planet's orbital period is about 1.57 Earth years, and it is tipped 3.9 kpc above and 2.6 kpc below the planet's orbital plane. Its velocity is about 0.08 c and it is 0.0556 Earth months distant.
The primary function of WASP @-@ 44 was to provide a starting point for independent SSA @-@ 4935 data acquisition by following the WASP @-@ 44 binary. The system is separated from the Earth by a faint haze of dust. Following the main Kepler star @-@ 4034, the dust was followed with 0.01 s signal acquisition by the 600x 551 telescope at IAU @-@ 1829 fw.
The initial data obtained by SSA @-@ 4935c and SSA @-@ 4935d, as well as the WASP @-@ 44 data set, were analyzed by Astrometric Associates, LLC. While following the WASP @-@ 44 and WASP @-@ 44 orbital paths, the planet WASP @-@ 44b was monitored, giving a gravitational mass as much as the Jupiter's, as well as known optical parameters. These values are near to observations and were supplemented by data from follow @-@ up observations using WASP @-@ 44b's primary spectra and post- astro @-@ measurements using SSA @-@ 4935c's spectra. By analyzing the point density, not only the gravitational mass and the optical parameters are determined, but also the star and planet's (or worlds' ) lifetimes. This resulted in the discovery of the transiting WASP @-@ 44b planetary system.

Prat ( Planetary Astrophysics, 2015) where it is described in more detail.
