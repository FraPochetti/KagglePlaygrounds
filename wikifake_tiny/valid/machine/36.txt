 The 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team was a New Zealand rugby union team that toured Britain , Ireland , Australia and New Zealand in 1888 and 1889 . It mostly comprised players of Māori ancestry , and also included some <unk> ( white New Zealanders ) . A wholly private <unk> , the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority ; it was organised by New Zealand international player Joseph <unk> , promoted by civil servant Thomas <unk> , and managed by James Scott , a <unk> . Scott ran the rugby team from the War Memorial ( St Helens ) and spent a lot of time at The Hornby Hotel, where players had their rooms for the duration of the tour. The team also had a less formal sounding logo than that used by the only other Māori team of the period, the <unk> from Wellington.

Apart from a few trials, and coaching by Benjamin Dawson, who also coached the Australian side in 1920 and the Americans in 1922, he had no experience coaching indigenous rugby and was a "geek" ( he was a teacher) who happened to be trained to coach rugby at the University of Auckland. 
Fitzgerald 1922 – 1923
During the 1920s and '30s, after his second year as coach (his third in fact), Fitzgerald became so interested in indigenous rugby that he travelled to Africa, and returned with an East African union team to Germany. His own team left New Zealand in 1928 for Germany. They had no English players, and the many roles they played in German rugby generally included being the referee and having to train against the German national team (they had their own national team, the <unk> from Rotterdam).   In 1928, Fitzgerald decided to take a drive around West Africa and observe the African Rugby Union (ARU) using the Flemish national side of the season: South Africa. 
Native team of South Africa
Who played for South Africa in the West African summer?  The idea was to see what a team would do against a team and an experience on the first hand, in a series of training games between different nations of the same country. It would be the new model of the game to allow for teams to travel and to interact together in one group. 
1880s
The 1890s to 1914 – 
The lives of the actual Native rugby players are not well preserved, but given that the toppers grew up around 1600, and these would have been around their mid-to late 20s, they would not have seen the modern sports system first hand. They would not have experienced what the modern upper class is all about. The interest in rugby in these years, were based mostly on the New Zealand Games. The first one took place in 1889 at Horlicks before Ticats teams had teams from other teams. In 1890, a report was made from the historical society at Hackney Hall, that in "many parts of the country" they had not seen the indigenous Rugby game, and were looking for the first ones from the 19th century. This was the first evidence that the Native sports were not unknown in New Zealand. ( In 1890, the first modern team of all NATIVE hotted up and sailed from Fetherston )

William Fitzgerald was a native of Cape York, and played for the Kanteini (the Māori team) for 14 years from 1866 to 1892. He was part of a Rangi in 1877, and also played rugby (where he died) in the 1890s. He lived in the Cape York countryside and trained as a doctor with the Cape York Hospital (now known as the Queen Mary Hospital ). He is a folklorist and historian, and wrote a book on Cape York's rugby team, in which he portrayed a role that was quite different to that of his own team, the Massey University Rugby Union ( Massey University Rugby Union is now known as New Zealand Rugby Union). William Fitzgerald was an  INFORMER  and in 1898 he was asked by the National Government to work as a teacher in a school for aboriginal children. His motives were the same as those of the later Native coaches.
