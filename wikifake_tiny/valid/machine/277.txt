 Giacomo Meyerbeer ( born Jacob Liebmann Beer ; 5 September 1791 – 2 May 1864 ) was a German opera composer of Jewish birth who has been described as perhaps the most successful stage composer of the nineteenth century . With his 1831 opera Robert le diable and its successors , he gave the genre of grand opera ' decisive character ' . Meyerbeer 's grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition . In contrast to this, operatic genres which dominated opera before the middle of the nineteenth century such as Alexandretta, Romantic period drama, dramatic comedy and dramatic tradition tended to be achieved by mixing German instruments with other musical traditions. There is ample evidence that Meyerbeer made a clear break from these musical traditions. He defined his grand opera as a single musical experience; the opera in itself was composed with reference to music of antiquity. Despite the variety of elements of Meyerbeer's music Meyerbeer concentrated on one single style, an aesthetic which he claimed was'alive ','perfect and still growing in its perfection '. Meyerbeer created his operas for the orchestra, which was then constructed with a common dress, in a monophonic form (9). The orchestra in each of Meyerbeer's operas are constructed of four separate musical acts, each given a different harmonic and rhythmic content. To avoid dissonance, each of the multiple musical acts are divided into six'up'parts; these correspond to the eight Roman numerals of the ancient Greek language. (10) When within an operatic repertoire, operas tend to follow a theme. The opening acts in musical Liszt's Ein Heldenleben were a mixture of two themes, each starting with a different musical'key '. (11) Nachdem Tod, 'who dreams the only dream', was first played in a dramatic setting in a beautiful variety of traditional settings including the 'Triumphal Gate' in Vienna (12). His first full-length opera The Return of La Fiorentina was written in 1850. He created another grand opera, Accademia, in 1858. The opera was formed into five'scaled' operas in the 1830s, each taken from a different group of musical parts. This production system has been called'systematic' in the twentieth century. We now have five operas: Nachdem Tod, Accademia, The Return of La Fiorentina, The Promenade ( the 1843 Act I); Tri-Rigio, The Birth of Venus (1858; the 1860 Act II); Kirche Monologus, La Bibliotheca Norciata (1861; the 1862 Act III); and The London Opera Company's Elgar's L'Eglise, known as La Mirage (1863), in the 1879–1880 Shakespeare cycle.

While many of the products of classical music – such as the Orchestra suites and 'traditions' – were created by "goofs" or "short works", some of Meyerbeer's works reflected his conception of his music as 'antique music'. For example, in The Promenade (1863), a Tragedy from the Tragedy of the Magi, the music was actually structured as six 'dialects' from the Greek language, which existed independently in the sources. Many of the best-known works of German operatic music used an 'antique' basis, such as Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, Mozart's Requiem, and Verdi's The Last Days of the War. The nineteenth century saw a trend toward the great unifying of various instruments (including male and female voices and instruments, piano, violin, and viola) in music, and against the application of what is termed 'intermotive music'. Each of the four German opera composers referred to these as'systematic music', which meant that an orchestra or orchestra concerto would be composed for all four works in a particular genre or style, and that composers would usually record their own arrangements for the final act in their works. The 'Grand Style' was a term used by Meyerbeer's sons, Max and Walter. It appears that each son 'adopted his father's musical ideas but in a different form'.
