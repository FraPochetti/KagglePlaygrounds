 Mycena galericulata is a mushroom species commonly known as the common bonnet , the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> @-@ gill fairy helmet . The type species of the genus Mycena was first described scientifically in 1772 , but was not considered a Mycena until 1821 . It is quite variable in color , size , and shape , which makes it somewhat difficult to reliably identify in the field . The most common type is the pink to red variety. The most well known Mycena is from Australia, and the cuttings and fruits have been collected there since the 1920s.
In 1876, Joseph M. Sacks described this species, the <unk> <unk> gill fairy helmet. The name Mycena was first given to this species in 1865.
Mycena is a gemmium, a common mushroom with various important medicinal uses. The cuttings and spores are easy to find in the woods ; it is by-and-large a rather dark brown and even vinaceous.
In the wild, it is recognized by its combination of pink, red and dark-colored cap, stems and fruits, which are excellent showy and nourishing.
A superb all-around light-colored example of this species is shown in this picture, courtesy (see m.m.s.)
&2 = Isoflavus proboscidea (Skannet Gum)
Isoflavus proboscidea is a fine tropical twirling mushroom that is readily identified in the wild by its bright yellow-orange cap and white stem. It has a non-fruiting alternate vascular system that runs across the stem, mimicking the vein openings of tricholoma. Also of note is that the entire stem becomes more red with age, and the stem coloration seems to increase with the age of the fruiting body. This is said to be good for removing your waste, and I thought it was worth mentioning. The name indicates that it is dried fruit, and is a clear example of the term pulpit, which is pretty old-fashioned when you think about it. It has been used medicinally in some Chinese cultures to treat colds and inflammation.
In common with many tropical horticulturists, Isoflavus proboscidea will not be available in small quantities until after the monsoon, but is available in some specialty shops in New Zealand.
Isoflavus proboscidea is often called the <unk> <unk> green horticultural; a good and self-sustaining one. See this website,
&3 = Isoflavus proboscidea and other varieties of the great red variety
Isoflavus pedunculata has received less attention than the other type species, but is also a species commonly used as an ornamental. The cap and stem are white, but the cap is greenish when ripe, and the stem colour changes to a light-yellow-orange. The fruits are hairy, and the fruits themselves are of thin, segmented scales, slightly resembling the scales of the wagtail on common snapdragons, but a darker shade than Snapdragon cormorant. They are eaten by poultry and pigs, and as a delicacy in general. They are also important food for fishers and small animals, such as rabbits.
The other species in this group is, I believe, the <unk> <unk> <unk> -@ gill fairy helmet. This type is often confused with Isoflavus, in my opinion, so I'm posting it here for the ease of listing and discussion. The colouration varies in this type from greenish to a smooth light-toned white and green or blue, with a broad banding of pale green along the margins. There is a blue u at the top of the cap and sometimes near the center of the stem, and a white 2 on the stem, and it also has a little white speck near the centre. The other two types have a dark'smoothed' cap and a flatter white stem. The fat white cap of Isoflavus pedunculata has only the very top 2 scales visible; the 2 in the other group are fully visible, and the underside of both caps and stems are very thin. A really excellent description of Isoflavus pedunculata can be found in Norman B. Dengwell, et al., new etymological issues on the identity of the tropical gill fairy, Mycena mycoides, lana.wild.answ., 75.2 (1994), pp. 237-238.
