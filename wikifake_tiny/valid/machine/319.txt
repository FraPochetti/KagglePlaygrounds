 Ceres ( / <unk> / ; minor @-@ planet designation : 1 Ceres ) is the largest object in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter . Its diameter is approximately <unk> kilometers ( <unk> miles ) , making it the largest of the minor planets within the orbit of Neptune . The thirty @-@ third @-@ largest known body in the Solar System , it is the only one identified orbiting entirely within the orbit of Neptune that is a dwarf planet . An asteroid, comet, or asteroid fragment (with no size or mass) of Ceres in this atmosphere would have been easy to photograph in 1986, but sadly, photographic techniques did not make that possibility a reality.
At its current distance of ~ 17 x 10 x (10.4 x <unk> / 4.6 x <unk> / <unk> ) kilometers from the Sun, Ceres is covered in a medium-sized dust layer, similar to that in the atmospheres of comets. This is not surprising, given the size and compositions of the first comets found in the outer solar system, when Ceres was first located, and the fact that no companion asteroids were present at this time. In addition, this period of favorable conditions must have been a lot warmer and more energetic than in an asteroid belt. Ceres, however, is a member of the asteroid belt, and therefore rotates within it. It has been identified at several distances from the sun, from the radius of the asteroid belt, to about ~ 160 AU. The low atmospheric pressure we find in the asteroid belt might also be the cause of the high vapor pressure in the asteroid's atmosphere. It has also been suggested that the high abundance of water that is being gushed into the asteroid's atmosphere by large amounts of comets is causing a redistribution of mass, because comets usually concentrate the abundance of water in their original orbits, which causes this mass to gravitationally grow.
