 The Church of Scientology has been present in Germany since 1970 . German authorities estimate that there are 4 @,@ 000 active Scientologists in Germany today ; the Church of Scientology gives a membership figure of around 12 @,@ 000 . The Church of Scientology has encountered particular <unk> from the German press and government and occupies a precarious legal , social and cultural position in Germany . The Church of Scientology was arrested in Germany in 1969 after an investigation by a police inquiry into charges of illegal book publishing and publishing pamphlets and books in Germany. The police investigation concerned the activities of Scientology operatives in Germany since the 1960's. A German police investigation resulted in the arrest and later conviction of six members of the Scientology organization in Germany who were charged with publishing this material. This was the first time that an organization having an interest in German culture had been specifically targeted. The Church of Scientology was "detained" by the German police for their activity in Germany. They were told that " they were being "politically " manipulated by Nazi Germany. It appears that the only news that was available to the German media was that the Church of Scientology had been raided in the name of "political" concerns. The German authorities did not press charges against the Church of Scientology which they had publicly declared to be a non-political organization (as declared by the German Foreign Office and the German Department for Constitutional Affairs )  in the wake of the German Communist Party (PDS). In a strange and ironic twist, the German government had in turn proposed for their entry into the German Constitution a non-political organization  for the purposes of preventing what the German Communist Party (PDS) (and its members) were doing in Germany. It was the German government, however, that began its "terror" campaign against the Church of Scientology and the PDS, for which it was responsible. In 1971, the Church of Scientology went public with a legal challenge to the Germany arrest of the Church in 1974. After the filing of this appeal, the German authorities did not prosecute the Church of Scientology nor did they make an effort to enforce laws, which were obviously written by officials who were seeking to neutralize any "organizational" activity that might pose a threat to the majority of the populace. However, in 1977, the "Communist-Free Germany" bill became law and laid the foundation for the creation of the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Police. The "Red One" (the Nazi Government) was just about to go on the offensive against the Scientology group and the German government and Church of Scientology  in Germany. In late February, 1978, the German authorities arrested the German Ambassador to New Zealand, Dr. Gerhard Van Flandern, and for possessing a prohibited book. This was reported by this magazine in October 1982. Over the next few weeks, the German media exploded with reports about the activities of the German Government and Church of Scientology. The Ministry of Interior was launched in early 1978 with the promised purpose of dealing with " organized criminal activity " and " the influence of Communist partisans in Germany "   (about 12 @,@ 000). The Minister was convinced that Scientology was responsible for the Communist activities and regarded the Church of Scientology as a potential dangerous group that could give all the Communist fronts a boost with all the tens of millions of dollars that would be generated by it. He was also convinced that there was in Germany a sizable group of Scientologists, possibly a thousand or more people, who had a vested interest in changing the way the German Government was dealing with them. Van Flandern was detained on charges of " organizing people to organize conspiracy and activity designed to overthrow the government ". His arrest led to the convictions of at least four Scientology operatives who were to continue their activity in Germany with the assistance of the prosecutor's office. In the spring of 1978, an investigation was launched by the German police into the allegations about various " Scientology" scandals. According to the official press, it was the official German police who were involved in the Church of Scientology at that time. A German court, on the other hand, released 6 of the Scientology operatives convicted on charges of spying for the Soviet Union. According to these reports, the Germans were interested only in " "political" concerns, and would not proceed with charges against the "organizations" involved, which were really concerned about the law enforcement and intelligence methods used to suppress and eradicate " terrorists " in German interests. The Court acquitted the members of the Church of Scientology who were behind the espionage scandal because they were acquitted, as far as they were concerned, because they were not " Politically active", and thus not considered responsible for an actual crime.
