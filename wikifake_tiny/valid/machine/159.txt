 Silver Bullet is a western @-@ themed steel inverted roller coaster designed by Bolliger & Mabillard located at Knott 's Berry Farm , an amusement park in Buena Park , California . The $ 16 million roller coaster was announced on December 1 , 2003 and opened on December 7 , 2004 . A first rider auction was also held where people would bid on seats to be the first riders . A contract was awarded to Bolliger & Mabillard and the coaster was at capacity on July 25, 2006. The Silver Bullet actually reached its capacity on June 23, 2006. On June 26, 2007, they announced the discovery of a new catastrophic safety flaw that may kill up to 90 people when the coaster is fully activated. They have identified that the new flaw is directly related to the outside opening mechanism.
SEMINAR SEF-4
SEF-4 was the 6th Spider-Man track as they replaced the previous DREAD (costing nearly $ 8 Million to make and only equaling $ 500,000,000 on building) and began construction in 2005. It was connected to the DREAD but running directly to the new type of track. The Silver Bullet sits atop the three corner monorail tracks that is directly beneath the Silverdrum at the amusement park. It can be seen in the picture above with the NAPA Railroad in the background.  
The Silver Bullet and Silverdrum together appear in the 2009 DC vs Marvel video game.
Notes :
- Gold Mine Stampede was the former Silverdrum at the Doheny Mine amusement park, but closed due to capacity issues. It was replaced by the Silver Bullet.
- The Iron Steed was built by DDD Brewing Company (now Zee Breweries). However, it is known that they acquired it from Zee Brewing Co. while working on it. It's changed direction since it's last seen at the Barktree Brewing Company in Covington, Kentucky. However, it can still be seen at Mazorba Raceway in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
- The Mechanical Mammoth was completed by Haas Bionetworks (later Black Rock Bicycle) in 2009. The circuit races were built by Madboy Bicycle Factory in Del City, Michigan. The track is built on a configuration of tracks from the Iron Steed. The circuit races are made up of two level track segments with 10 NM each, with 30 NM left and right of the podium to force spectators to drive right and left at their own risk of being hit by a speeding up mechanic. It is also known that Haas sold the track to Tomko Toypusch of Sugimori Speedway, a works-financed Japanese co-starring track.
- The Blue Collar Biker (  Antebellum) was built by McDonalds (now The Fast Food Chain in Michigan). As always, its design is unknown but it has been known to resemble the Antebellum's design. The Blue Collar Biker isn't as visible in the picture above as the other Bikers as it's not located on a track or ramps.
- Clark Kent's Propeller Cruiser  was constructed by USA Tri-Town Dopers (now All Star Fun Cars). There is also a Minnie Mouse coaster by Miller Park while it's not even listed among the Five Realms. There was also an Ironman kart in the toy line, but it doesn't look like it's made by Metropolis and it doesn't ride, so it doesn't count. As always, the Super Young track is described in the information, but in the pictures it doesn't look anything like what is depicted in the Toy catalog.
-The Super Dildo was created by Magic Bullets (now 4pix Magic Bullets). The track, surprisingly, is not this to be used as part of any kids track or an open air ride. Instead, it was attached to a hoop filled with test equipment which the riders pass through while sitting on their backs. It was shown to be a large, squat tube, maybe the size of a VW Bus.
-The Super Late Night Sign ( California Slim ) was created by Orange County Toy a LLC and shared by 1st Thirsties Inc. While the venue isn't known by the members of the 1st Thirsties, the Super Late Night Sign could be used as the house sign for the park. It has a seat, mid-track ballast, and does not feature the patent sheet (see picture above). The sign is new on September 24, 2014.
-The Wonderlic is a device developed by OBD-II device maker Tony Hill to ensure products in a controlled environment. It is sold as a part of an OBD-II compliant vehicle.
