Transcript [ edit ]

[A man wearing a sailor suit has just walked in on Shlomi Eldar and Tracy Jordan and they all laugh, while an adress is displayed to where a man can be seen waving his arms, along with the fourth floor of the building he is at. The man exits the mannequin, is enveloped in a corner of the painting and he again begins walking towards Tracy.] Man: Ya—you like it, so I'm letting you inside the Renaissance! Mannequin: Yeah! Mannequin: Just come back, you need someplace warm! Man: Yeah! Man: This room's warm and is up to your standards! Man: Yeah! Man: Oh you've gotta go to the Ace Beauty! Mannequin: Now, if you need something, you know where to find me. Man: Yeah. Man: If you need something, you know where to find me. Man: Ya—you like it, so I'm letting you in the Renaissance. Mannequin: Yeah! Mannequin: Just come back, you need someplace warm! Man: Yeah! Man: This room's warm and is up to your standards! Man: Yeah! Man: And I'm trying to get you what you need, all the way to Quincy! Mannequin: Yeah! Mannequin: Just come back, you need someplace warm! Man: Yeah!

[The man introduces himself as Shlomi Eldar, or as he's seen in the line-up, the mysterious gentleman at the top of the building, whose questions and presentation usually attracts attention to itself and to those talking in it, along with his only problem with the environment] Man: Shlomi Eldar, if you're looking for two...

[A man that's a tad too calm and bashful talking to Shlomi Eldar (instead of Shlomi Eldar talking back to him or simply answering and expressing interest, so that Eldar understands that the man is not certain whether he's his "friend" or not)] Man: Wha—wow, you know what this is? Man: Okay! First of all, would you like a deck of cards? Man: That's lovely, that's really nice.

[Three framed pictures of a man, Wanda, and Tracy are on the table.] Man: I know! I didn't realize it was me! Wanda: Yeah, I wasn't aware that you were a master gambler at all. Man: Mmm hmm. Mannequin: Really, dude? Man: Do you have any more junk on you? Mannequin: Yeah, I'm now paying some people to go out and buy it for me. Mannequin: So will I pay you to get that big pile of jewelry? Man: Nah, I'm kind of struggling. Mannequin: Okay! Where are you headed? Man: Down the East River to those guys in New Jersey. Mannequin: Are you crazy? [The men talk among themselves about how good it was to have made the trip there, including Walter here to meet up with the guys] Mannequin: That's great. Man: Say, do you know any people I could be meeting that would want to talk to me? Mannequin: Can you bring them? Mannequin: Yeah, I can! Man: Why is that important? Mannequin: Well, you know, some people we know or hear of are very helpful in a large number of occasions, or because they're good or awesome, which is really relevant to any of us. Man: (rummages in his jeans pocket) Oh! Mannequin: Let's say you want to see me at the theater, or go for a walk.
