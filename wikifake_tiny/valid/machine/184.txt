 USS Breese ( DD â€“ 122 ) was a Wickes class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War I , and later redesignated , DM @-@ 18 in World War II . She was the only ship named for Captain <unk> Breese . 
 Commissioned as a destroyer in 1919 , she undertook a number of patrol and training duties along the East Coast of the United States until being decommissioned in 1922 . She was presented to the government for scrapping on 28 August 1928 and spent the next 33 years rusting away, mostly as a storage yard before finally being transferred to the Maritime Museum of San Diego. In October 2012, she was designated as the newest member of the Fleet of the United States Navy in the USS San Diego Collection. She was constructed by Wickes Shipbuilding and was marked by her 2" hull. Under the ownership of the San Diego Museum of Art, she had an extremely distinguished career, including three tours of duty with the United States Navy. By the time she sank in June 1943, she was owned by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the original owner.

As the vessel sank, I think there was a lot of curiosity about what happened to her. Did she hit a sea mine? Did she get hit by a ship? Did she run aground? Did she sink in the surf? How about turning over and getting mucked up? By the time she was found by searchers, they had about fifty yards of rough concrete, suggesting that perhaps the destruction of the vessel was much more extensive than anything reported by the survivors. She was listed by the Navy as one of the largest military aircraft carriers lost during World War II, having served on 27 missions. This lost carrier was lost due to explosion of the two 3.4-inch shell casings in its hangar ring. The shell casings were 120 feet from the ship's bow and 200 feet from the waterline. The ship was sunk by 33 feet of water above the decks of the aircraft. The overall effect of that miscalculation had been tremendous.
By 16 May 1944, she was the largest destroyer lost in World War II, owned by the DEA, the original owner of the ship. Had the ship sunk in the water, her last mortal wound would have been 20 feet below the deck of her hangar.

Another highlight was her gigantic national monument to American heroes at Santa Fe, NM, where she rests in the summer, rusting away the rust and more of its eerie crew, now gone and never to return. The search for that last human, and he was a tough one. At first, the San Diego Legend was an urban legend, generated by accounts of the disaster (largely due to the decimation of the news media and the aircraft manufacturers). Thanks to a visit to the National Museum of Naval Aviation at the Wright Field yard, historians learned that this legend existed well before the wreck was found. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) acquired it from the Naval Historical Center in 1954. The Navy managed to locate this early version of the story. This larger vessel was a terrible laugher, with no enemy with a greater chance of spotting her than local law enforcement.
Today, that story is the latest Marine Corps version of the myth. It also refers to one the most fortunate encounters of the Marine Corps. In 1979, a local Florida man named Randall Balcher saw this beautiful hulk adrift in the Atlantic at an unsafe distance from shore, running dangerously close to land. The immense aircraft carrier Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) North Island (formerly Marine Corps Air Station El Toro), whose name was changed to MCS El Toro in the 1980's (EULOR), was still underway. In his view, as the wing folded over her left side, she immediately began to sink, a sight that must have changed his life forever. As he watched, the craft slowly decelerated. How fast was he able to see what was happening? I'm not sure. Anyway, with their ship dangerously near land and it listed heavily, the Marine Commander decided it was time for shore leave. After the landing, Balcher managed to communicate with some of the Marine combat engineers, and it was determined that the flight deck had been fully penetrated and that the aircraft carrier had been struck by gunfire. The effect of the crash would have been catastrophic had the condition of the firewalls been the same at the time of impact.

As will likely happen with most missing aircraft carriers, there was an attempted rescue.
