 The 1986 Peach Bowl was a post @-@ season American college football bowl game at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta , Georgia between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the North Carolina State Wolfpack from on December 31 , 1986 . The game was the final contest of the 1986 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season for both teams , and ended in a 25 â€“ 24 victory for Virginia Tech , the first bowl victory in school history . The Wolfpack won their final three regular season games to secure their third straight bowl victory. Only eight schools had ever won at least three ACC Atlantic Division regular season title games in one season. The 1987, 1988 and 1989 seasons were included in the playoffs. In 1989, the Wolfpack earned an at-large bid to the prestigious 1987 NCAA Championship. In that game, Wolfpack quarterback Andra Davis threw for 390 yards and 3 touchdowns and ran for 133 yards and 4 TDs.
In the 1987 season, Tech ran on the first play of its game to gain a 14-0 lead. Defense led by future Washington Senator Rick Wilson held on to lead their opponents to only 5-4 at the half, on their way to a 31-6 halftime lead. Then in the second quarter, Tech took the lead at the end of the quarter when Davis was sacked but recovered the ball by quarterback Billy Swann. After Tech gained the ball on their next possession, the Carolina defense in the red zone made a "fake" punt in order to line up receiver Greg Royle open in the corner of the endzone. Swann then ran a corner route to speed up the defense. Royle went over the top to break up the pass, with the coverage being deep. However, the defense, unaware that Swann's route was an improvised return, lined up with more coverage covering Royle. After the catch, Swann ran back to cover for teammate Steve Tasker, who managed to make a 60-yarder. For the second time that year, the #21 defense was used more on offense than defense.
After a 14-0 Hokie lead in the second half, the North Carolina State Wolfpack grabbed the lead on the first play of the third quarter, but Virginia Tech found a way to regain the lead on the next drive. Running back Steve Royle scored on a 24-yard rush, and then the Hokies gained the lead at the 2:25 mark on a 47-yard field goal by Aaron Mauti. Tech added two more points to the lead on a 30-yard field goal by Aaron Mauti after an interception by Crabtree for a 14-0 advantage. After a Tech score of 12-0, North Carolina State cut the lead to 13-0 at the 10:35 mark, but, Tech scored the final seven points of the game.
After a Power 7 conference championship victory over Michigan in the 2003 Orange Bowl, the Hokies won the #2 seed in the 1991 A&M All-America Game, earning the right to face #3 Virginia in the 1991 Las Vegas Bowl. The Hokies ended up losing in five overtimes, and scored only 9 points in the game.
In 1991, the Hokies had one of the best collegiate football recruiting programs in the country, led by current Hokies quarterback Tim Tebow. In the 1991 season, Tech signed 22 defensive backs, 19 of which were at the college level. Eight of those players had at least one season of NFL service, and four were drafted by the NFL. The Hokies have also brought in three players that were both drafted by the NFL and joined the Hokie football team. Quarterback Billy Swann, offensive lineman Kelt Johnson, and wide receiver Michael Carter all won NCEA-AA Division I All-American games in 1991. Tech opened the 1991 season 0-0 against Penn State, but came back and won five straight to open the season, including a bowl victory at Richmond. On the season, the Hokies scored their first 10 points in the fourth quarter of their first game against Northern Illinois, and did the same against Duke. The Hokies did not score any points until the 14-1 victory over Penn State. In their ACC opening conference championship game, the Hokies beat Cincinnati in convincing fashion with a late Ben Boulware FG. For the season, the Hokies had scored 798 points, which put them just ahead of Army (762 points). Tech added 9 rushing TDs, including their last 7 in the final three quarters to tie them with the 1984 St. Louis Cardinals.
In 1992, Tech closed the regular season strong, defeating Maryland in the ACC title game. Tech looked to cement its championship as they traveled to Atlanta to face Georgia Tech.
