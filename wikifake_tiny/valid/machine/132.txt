 The Civilian Public Service ( CPS ) was a program of the United States government that provided conscientious objectors with an alternative to military service during World War II . From 1941 to 1947 , nearly 12 @,@ 000 draftees , willing to serve their country in some capacity but unwilling to perform any type of military service , accepted assignments in work of national importance in 152 CPS camps throughout the United States and Puerto Rico .  But the policy's rationale was not patriotism, rather it was a statement against civilian control of the military. 
After the war ended in 1945, the CPS camps shut down. As such, it was repealed with the creation of the National Personnel Service System, a new program of civilian recruitment for civilian positions. 
CPS is the first program of its kind, and the first civil service program to be formed in the United States.  Instead of choosing their active duty position, participants must apply to the Comite d'action Francaise for public service employment.  Before joining the office of a governor, as citizens of France, they must take the oath of citizenship (licence du nom d'assurance des faites)  and pass a French examination. (For Germans, it was also necessary to take the Imperial Hanoverian Oath, or Weimar Constitution, but not the Second Oath.)  The [coming?] new system is 100 percent merit-based, leading to consistent representation of men and women in the upper ranks.
The course of military service becomes compulsory for citizens once they reach the age of 18 years.  At that point, they are considered to have served their country.  After that age, they begin collecting re-education, but are able to waive or waive those provisions at their discretion.  Until the end of the calendar year ( March ) of their 14th birthday, they can receive a grant of deferment from the Selective Service System.  Citizens will continue to be recruited and placed into the CPS camps in California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. 
As recently as May 2009, the agency had over 1,100 selectees waiting to join. Currently, 19,000 people attend the first 10 courses for the CPS training program in Kansas. At the beginning of January, 1,000 women (and one man) were filling out a form in order to apply for the Master of Public Administration program. 
While the job market for people entering the CPS camps remains extremely bad, and increasingly underemployed, it has been restored, albeit slowly, with the addition of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on January 1, 2012.  U.S. citizens who obtained a provisional green card as an immigrant can work on weekends, with a few benefits, in the MPA program, while awaiting their temporary D-1 status.
(Because the MPA program is designed to be temporary, the years of residence they are able to work are the same ones they are able to stay in the camps.)
Furthermore, every two years, the federal government takes measures to distribute refugees through two resettlement agencies: One is called the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Refugee Service; the other is called the Washington Conference on Catholic Relief Services. They are the same organizations with a long history of having found every possible means of working with the U.S. government to alleviate poverty in the developing world. 
The idea is that by resettling refugees, the government may show a glimpse into how difficult life is for ordinary people in the developing world. 
There are now some 200,000 refugees in Paraguay, and a similar number in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Eritrea. There are as many refugees in the Sudan as there are in the entire state of Colorado. And that is just in the camps and not the camp communities.
