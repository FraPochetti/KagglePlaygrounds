 The 1806 Great Coastal hurricane was a severe and damaging storm along the East Coast of the United States which produced upwards of 36 in ( 91 cm ) of rainfall in parts of Massachusetts . First observed east of the Lesser Antilles on 17 August , the hurricane arrived at the Bahamas by 19 August . The disturbance continued to drift northward and made landfall at the mouth of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina on 22 August . However, the storm weakened before reaching landfall, and was picked up by another storm off the coast of Florida on 25 August, resulting in approximately 60 in ( 160 cm ) of rain in some places and 50 in ( 130 cm ) in some places. Some weather systems fell away near its landfall before returning. Following the 1806 Great Coastal hurricane, a drenching rainfall event occurred during the evening of 24 August. An additional 3 to 4 inches ( 8 to 10 cm ) of rain was recorded in parts of North Carolina, Virginia, and South Carolina, where the Category 3 Hurricane Sandy was tracking westward as a low-pressure system. Sandy entered a tropical depression on the west coast of North America at 23 August, not far from the point at which the Great Coastal hurricane passed by. Sandy is the only hurricane of the five officially named by the International Hurricane Center to make landfall in the United States in 1806.
