 Typhoon Imbudo , known in the Philippines as Typhoon <unk> , was a powerful typhoon that struck the Philippines and southern China in July 2003 . The seventh named storm and fourth typhoon of the season , Imbudo formed on July 15 to the east of the Philippines . The storm moved generally west @-@ northward for much of its duration due to a ridge to the north . <unk> conditions allowed Imbudo to intensify , gradually at first before undergoing rapid deepening on July 19 . The typhoon's broad pressure maximum was 5.447- 5.454 mb (30-32.68 wt.%), with strong wind shear at 75 kt and rapid swell. Multiple sub-arctic storm tracks and eastward winds drove Imbudo from its former location along the tropical eastern coast of the Philippines, then southward northward over the entire Pacific. In early August, Imbudo dissipated over the Pacific, with the disturbance intensifying at 10 a.m.. Imbudo crossed the Bering Sea and into the Arctic Ocean. At the time Imbudo disappeared, a severe hurricane season across the eastern U.S., as well as southeast Asia, were underway. Imbudo and its damaging winds devastated neighborhoods as far east as Atlanta, Georgia and as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia. On August 18, Imbudo weakened enough to undergo a number of recovery phases, with the remnants able to weaken further to 9.4 mb (29 wt.%), and return northward over northern Central America, Japan, and northern New Zealand. Typhoon Iman Iman, known in the Philippines as  Typhoon  imor, had weakened to 8.5 mb (26 wt.%) on August 19. The Philippine typhoon has a maximum diameter of 110 km (68 nautical miles), with maximum sustained winds of 35 kt (80 mph). Typhoon Iman is the eighth named storm and third typhoon of the season.  Iman is located just north of Manila, Philippines. The Philippine typhoon is known to track eastward around the central Philippines, then northward to the Philippines north coast in late August. Iman has a maximum temperature of 20.2°C (68.7°F), with maximum wind speed of 43 kt (70 mph). Both Imbudo and Iman preceded typhoons to the northwest, with both the strongest typhoons originating from the Philippines. Iman was a large windstorm and generated a large tsunami; at the time of its landfall the Philippines issued an evacuation notice.
