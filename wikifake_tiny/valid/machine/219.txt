 Marshall Herff Applewhite , Jr . ( May 17 , 1931 – March 26 , 1997 ) , also known as " Bo " and " Do " , among other names , was an American cult leader who founded what became known as the Heaven 's Gate religious group and organized their mass suicide in 1997 - claiming the lives of thirty @-@ nine people . 
 A native of Texas , Applewhite attended several universities and , as a young man , served in the United States Army . Applewhite later told his followers to commit mass suicide after the Sept 11, 2001 attacks, thinking that the attack would lead people to believe that what he and his followers were doing was some kind of illegal cult ritual. 
Applewhite died while riding in a car driven by Brett Snyder to his alibi, in Minnesota, and his name was not on the driver's side or side mirror of the vehicle. 
Members of Applewhite's church burned paper copies of the Ten Commandments, and called it the " Ten Commandments of God ", which was the first time that someone was personally burned to death in a religious event. 
Applewhite also attempted to make himself look like God himself by burning his Satanic writings as well as Satanic graffiti in his personal and places belonging to other people.  In 2009, Applewhite's son, Brett, revealed that Applewhite and his followers were planning on setting himself and his girlfriend, Susan Schuller, on fire.  Brett and Susan were found dead later on.
Those behind the Heaven's Gate killings were aided by one Scott Roeder, a former Army man who also took part in the sacrificial acts.  Applewhite, a former Army police officer, had planned to cover up the bodies of his thirty nine victims, and Roeder attempted to do just that.  Scott Roeder was sentenced to life in prison in 1999 for killing nine individuals and injuring eleven others, including the mother of the victims.  Scott Roeder and Applewhite were arrested on murder charges, but each had a defence lawyer.  Brett Applewhite and the surviving defendant, Scott Roeder, also faced drug charges that, when dropped, ultimately resulted in their release from prison and eventual incarceration at a state penitentiary in Ohio.  Brett Applewhite was never able to prove that his mother was not actually dead.  Scott Roeder was also able to recover a handgun, which was originally taken from him during the investigations.  A variety of other items, most of them firearms, were also found at the crime scenes.  Scott Roeder is currently serving a life sentence for murdering the mother and stabbing three of her other children.  By using the 6.5 inch handgun that he recovered, Scott Roeder managed to stab his mother over an inch-and-a-half long and ten inches high with a nine-inch gash.
