 The Cambodian Campaign ( also known as the Cambodian <unk> and the Cambodian Invasion ) was a series of military operations conducted in eastern Cambodia during 1970 by the United States and the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) ( <unk> ) during the Vietnam War . These invasions were a result of the policy of President Richard Nixon . A total of 13 major operations were conducted by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) between 29 April and 22 July and by US forces between 1 May and 30 June . The Operation Tet Offensive, which marked the high point of the campaign, was one of the most famous campaigns of the Vietnam War. The three major operations and a prelude to the grand invasion of Cambodia were named Operation North Vietnam. The first of the three operations saw the evacuation of the United States embassy in Saigon. These evacuations were part of a joint United States/US ROK Operation Yap, which included the departure of two dozen aircraft. They were also part of Operation Wheeler. On 25 May 1972, a battalion of US Army Air Force (USAAF) F-4G Phantom IIs participated in the bombing raid on the USS Pueblo. Another USAAF F-4G, belonging to the 353rd Tactical Fighter Wing, had also been involved in the USAAF Pueblo raid. Two days later, on 30 May 1972, two B-52 strategic bombers, FW-190s and F-15Cs, bombed sites in the Kyin Ker district. The air action was part of Operation Starfish [ 1 ]. The attacks were also a part of Operation North Vietnam.
Operation Airdrop Airdrop in which a guided bomb is released from a Predator or Reaper drone. Airdrops are typically directed at manned vehicles. However, the US Air Force RAAF and the Royal Australian Air Force are also capable of performing Airdrops. In August 2011, the Australian Air Force RAAF took delivery of a Long Range Precision-Guided Bomb (LRPG) with IR-guided high-explosive bombs for use in Airdrops [ 2 ]. Some of these bombs were carried on the first Australian air operation in Afghanistan [ 3 ]. Other countries in Europe and Asia also can perform Airdrops. For example, the UK RAF has recently purchased a pair of medium-range precision-guided GBU-31 JDAMs and an Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) system from United States, using them in Airdrops against enemy fighters and weapons sites.
Operation Coyote Each year on 15 May, the Pentagon drops more than 20,000 tons of bombs, missiles and ammunition in the Middle East. In the first five months of 2010 alone, 12,000 tons of bombs, missiles, and high-explosive ammunition have been dropped in the area of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2.7 million tons in the rest of the world, 1.2 million tons in Europe and America and 1.5 million tons in Africa. The Pentagon also uses 17,000 guided bombs in the four Middle East theatres, 28,000 more in North Africa and 14,000 more in South Asia. The Pentagon also works to cover the four wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Yemen. These missions involve providing aircraft, ships, and aircraft crews to act as part of a Combined Joint Task Force.
In 2001, a trio of 3% US tactical nuclear missiles in Spain came down in Afghanistan, but it was not considered a nuclear detonation, since the missile's warhead was only 220 kg (551 lbs) and its yield of 20 kilotons was not sufficiently large to be a detonation threat to human beings or things. However, this incident left the US Navy dismayed. A nuclear warhead, if it is deemed to be on the situation-level, is capable of being capable of wiping out 20 states in a single day. The latter fact was brought up at a hearing on the US Navy's FY 2010 budget proposal and led to the Vice-Admiral's resignation [ 4 ] and the creation of a Security Status on US nuclear weapons; the proposal recommended to limit the amount of nuclear weapons and the threat to them to a "near-term" level. In 2006, the US Navy launched its first submarines, the Virginia-class, which could carry nuclear bombs as well as cruise missiles. This was deemed a "high probability" nuclear war on the situation level and subsequently of military significance.
US to Marrakesh to March 2010 [ 5 ] In 2009, a pair of 3% US tactical nuclear missiles deployed in Spain came down in Afghanistan, but it was not considered a nuclear detonation, since the missile's warhead was only 220 kg (551 lbs) and its yield of 20 kilotons was not sufficiently large to be a detonation threat to human beings or things. However, this incident left the US Navy dismayed.
