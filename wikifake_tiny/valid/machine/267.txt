 Midge <unk> is a fictional doll character in the Barbie line of toys by Mattel that was first released in 1963 . Midge was created , along with <unk> , to counteract criticism that claimed Barbie was a sex symbol . She was marketed as Barbie 's best friend . No Midge dolls were sold for the rest of the vintage years after the 1960s . 
 Midge was re @-@ introduced in 1988 as part of the play line , though two vintage reproduction dolls were made specifically for collectors in 1993 and 1998 . 
 The non-collector dolls also came in atlases for Laggies collection, if you were lucky.
Some collectors were lucky enough to own a Midge directly from the Mattel stores, so the following list will list the stocks ( order of sold prices of the the former plus vintage present- order of sold prices of the old or current ) 
Group 237651 APTC ZV Toys Art & Crafts. Followed by art supplies 
The final line was APTC darlings from 2002, and are the toys that are still a staple for collectors in this line. This group was by far the most sought after.
APTC dolls are plastic with either hard plastic ( Midge, Midge Plus, Midge Humanoid, ) or soft plastic ( Midge Slim, ) parts for more realism in a broader assortment. Also, they come in eyes with less or no eyeliner, tattoos, hilted noses, mouth, long hairs, toes and it also comes with wigs for doll models. Because of the world's limitations on ponchos, this range includes a whole heap of textured bangles to match the dolls' skin. The original APTC batch started in 1963 and the more recent batches began in 1990 and 2000.
Now, now. So how many APTC darlings are out there for collectors? Well, a few people can't be wrong, and I might be one of them ;-) APTC darlings are generally, but not always, those small figures (pre-Danbooru BD and original collection ), with some different body parts, that come in some variation of many variations of black and brown plastic. Some APTC collectors will go for APTC Midge so that you can select the one with all the cowls. APTC Midge has pre-DD versions, but probably the newer version, which has an antenna, took over the market in the early 90s (though with the rise of the plattform, a few years ago again it became popular ). APTC Midge has always been at least in a great number, both here and around the world ;-) You can buy them ( you can compare with current) in almost every APTC doll range, from most plastic to very intricate things. They can be found all over the planet, of course, and they are surely the single most ever-popular toy in the world of APT :D
Midge darlings still exist in the Playware so if you're that perverted, buy one!

In March 2006, Mattel Japan started production of a new APTC line called Pre-DDM. The new line will include some old Midge and APTC darlings ( APTC Milano and APTC Midge Slim, for example) and will have even more kits than the already existing APTC dolls. As of now, this figure line still hasn't been officially announced. Maybe the bigger and better APTC darlings will be coming, maybe the new Pre-DDM line is a new line, something (or nothing ) in between, or even something completely different, like a line of APTC busts. After all, all dolls in Mattel Japan's new line are the same. So, I do know what I'm talking about.
