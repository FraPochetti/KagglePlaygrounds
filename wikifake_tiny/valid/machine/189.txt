 Oribi ( pronounced / <unk> / ) ( <unk> ourebi ) is a small antelope found in eastern , southern and western Africa . The sole member of its genus , the oribi was first described by the German zoologist <unk> August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1782 . Eight subspecies are identified . The oribi reaches nearly 50 – 67 centimetres ( 20 – 26 in ) at the shoulder and weighs 12 – 22 kilograms ( 26 – 49 lb ) . The limb length is 46 to 71 centimetres ( 20 – 31 in ) and the tail is 60 centimetres ( 21 in ) long. In eastern Africa, it breeds mainly in northern and eastern Africa. Its largest known population is in northeastern, eastern Tanzania. Subspecies and subspecies are separated into six families, Pima, Nubian, Qarani, Aka, Tutsi, and Ithai. There are currently 3,131 total known subspecies. The genus name of Oribi describes the antelope's diet of the secretions of its glandular and mucous membranes. The word was derived from the Greek words <unk> and <crzdima> (lustrum).
Some of the mentioned subspecies of Oribi :
An undescribed subspecies of Oribi. In this species, the antelope are well-developed, longer and stronger than their European ancestors.  A rare occurence of a large and very developed specimen of Oribi in the Late Holocene in Eastern Africa.
- The githu, this species differs from its European relatives in that it lives in arid and semi-arid parts of central and southern Africa. It is slightly more prominent than its European ancestors, less so than the haplodont of the late-Holocene cavegates. 
- The Githu appears to have the largest body size and is not extremely well-developed. The largest specimens are around 70 centimetres ( 2 ft 4 in ) and the longest reaches a length of around 60 centimetres ( 2 in). They live mainly in desert environments, primarily around the Sahara Desert, while the largest specimens are in Namibia and Angola.  The githu is also known as the guina and is a hybrid between the  Oribi and  Oribio.
- The Oribi, an undescribed species of the Oribi which lives in southeastern, eastern Africa. Notable also for its relatively short body size, this species appears to be rather compact in that its body weighs between 5 and 10 kilograms ( 12 – 18 lb ). The antelope has strong legs and a relatively long tail. Its area of distribution is mainly located between southern, northwestern and eastern Africa, with special expansion of its range in West Africa. While it is a heterospecies, the existence of its hybrids has raised the question as to whether the Oribi, while occuring in the same areas as the Oribi, might exhibit a different arboreal diet, or exist in a different ecosystem with the Oribi.
- The <ghimbra> is a large mammal native to northeastern and southwestern Africa, found mainly in desert environments, especially in the Okavango delta. It can grow up to approximately 55 centimetres ( 18 in ) in length, though the smallest specimens can reach only a width of around 4 centimetres ( 1 inch). 
- The <iwasiku> ( pronounced / <iwish> / ) is another hippopotamus-like beast, found mostly in southwestern, northern and eastern Africa. The largest specimen of the genus by far, the igwasiku is estimated to be approximately 50 centimetres ( 18 in ) in length, with an area of distribution more or less similar to that of the iguana. It has similar coloration, a teardrop-shaped head, long triangular ears and two short legs. While most species of the Igwasiku, including the oribi and the ivuchus, are morphologically similar, the <iwasiku> species differs from the Igwasiku in several notable attributes. A recent study of the combined DNA of three herds of Igwasiku found a significant difference in the ratio of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA between these two species. The researchers hypothesized that this difference may be related to the observation that the majority of the Igwasiku are found in steppe areas, while the Igwasiku bred in arid climates. There is currently only one subspecies of the <iwasiku>, this one is probably related to the igwasiku and is distributed more to the south and west than to the north and east.
- The <axosai> is a cattle antelope that is native to the Central and Northern Africa.
