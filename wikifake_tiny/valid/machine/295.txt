 SMS Markgraf was the third battleship of the four @-@ ship KÃ¶nig class . She served in the Imperial German Navy during World War I. The battleship was laid down in November 1911 and launched on 4 June 1913 . She was formally commissioned into the Imperial Navy on 1 October 1914 , just over two months after the outbreak of war in Europe . Markgraf was armed with ten 30 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 12 @.@ mm ) guns, six 2.@ mm ( 0.9 in ) recoilless guns and three 16 @.@ 5 cm ( 5 in ) large caliber ( 127 @.@ mm ) unarmored guns. She had a 5,000 ton displacement and a beam of 21.5 m ( 76 ft 6 in ). The was completed in 1916. The SMS Markgraf was part of the German cruiser Squadron (SdKfz. 007), which consisted of four heavy cruisers, four battleships and two destroyers. The first half of 1916 saw the start of the German naval service under the command of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. The series of battleships along with the new new super-carriers Erwin Rommel's and (The) Eiffel were seen at sea but there was a critical moment in the war when they didn't appear in service. Undeterred, the German military endeavored to build a large number of operational German ships in collaboration with the German shipyards. The problem was that every ship was built in large part by local specialists, most of which did not work together in a cohesive unit.
