Máire pai an ces cas bá thair ca fionn Iraidean-Rice ( ( )   séan, 9th February 1648, held at Beaumont Street, London, this collection was given to the artist by the
daughter of a kinsman of his in the parish of Siith, in relation to Mrs. Lee; it was opened to Sir Kenneth Balfour. It consisted of papers and articles related to the law and practice in England of persons of wealth and reputation. It was the gift of James Alcock, a gentleman of such reputation that all respect, except that of a certain nobleman, had been bestowed on him by the king and this largess was repeated at the hands of a particular nobleman, to the sum of £10,000.
There were two copies of the collection, one kept in the drawing room of the house and one in a more secluded place.
It was by chance that the latter item came into the hands of the poet before he had come to Scotland. In a letter to a friend, dated 26 December 1652, he wrote:
" A man, who as one of the judge's family was found guilty of murder, was considered by a most highly respectable man to be " a fellow-poet ". But upon asking about this, I was told that he had given away a vast sum of money in extorting a civil suit against the judge and about twelve hundred pounds the aforesaid man, while we were hanging on the dyke. Then, to account for that, he took a great deal of money and gave it to several respectable men, intending to have them charge off the state of the land of what he had taken out of it. They lay as yet unwilling to do that thing, for if he were killed, and everyone believed that he was not, the lawyers would collect the king's money. The other man has not been in Scotland lately.
At that time it is curious to notice that this girl-poet, who we shall be dealing with again in the future, did not escape the notice of the bishops of Bishopsgate and St. Magnus.
1648 John Kenneth Balfour, " le syne Balfour et Barkeley", was an Irish member of the House of Commons and was knighted in 1649.
His daughter was married by her mother.
