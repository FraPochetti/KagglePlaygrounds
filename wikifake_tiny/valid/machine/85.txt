His Distinguished Service and Career
This entry is a work in progress. Contributions and sources will be added to the end of this page, but any help would be greatly appreciated. In addition to making this work, my task is to be well-known in Canada. This task does not exclude securing any recognitions that are possible.
The following military career/ achievement: 1.   Britain during the era of the Napoleonic Wars with U.S. Navy. 2.   1842-1843. 3.   1861-1862. 4.   1865-1867.
As a speaker and propagandist, Mathews was strongly influenced by those who, during the 'Age of Revolution' and 'Manifest Destiny', had delivered masses of eloquence and had emphasised the public interest in independent, productive, creative action.  Mathews spent much of his life in the United States, promoting and publishing free information. His contribution to the greater understanding and unity of a number of nations was incredible.  The following list is a contribution by the writer to this flow of discourse. *   I can be considered a product of my own generation, since my family, in my family's national society, I have shown more respect for the above figures as citizens of the United States, than any other patriot.   Therefore, this list can be considered comprehensive (no specific figures have been omitted) and allows one to estimate what would have been and could have been the standard for all the subsequent figures based upon standards so often (and rightly) elevated on the Westward approach to greatness.   A few of the most important not discussed are the Civil War, and the American Civil War. But, equally important is that of the U.S. Colonies.  These two are not indexed on the work below. The record of the Civil War is generally worthy of note, if not of recognition, as a Civil War fought to a peculiarly American trait, the unification of America and World history. The American cause was not without its military heroes; but the principal, two other figures were William Tecumseh Sherman, of the Union army, and Moses Granger, of the Confederacy. Those that represent the category of American Heroes are the Union commanders, those that represent the Confederate commanders, and their Confederate war, the Washington Generals and the Charleston Generals. The New York Generals and the Boston Generals.  The Generals Sherman and Granger were seen as notable and brave for having no encroachments upon the separate affairs of the States and the Nation of the United States.   The politics of both parties, while arguably similar, were distinctly different. Sherman was widely known for his zeal, as well as having a coherent view and not a belief in any of the supposed prophets of a "higher class" of men and forces. Granger for all his wars was widely known to be obstinate, but not to have any regard for the succession of persons that might arise, and his failure to take dictation without oversight of others, was the definitive sign of the deficiency of political consciousness of the captains of Georgia's Army.   For the analysis of this Generals and Confederate Generals matter be far exceeded.
