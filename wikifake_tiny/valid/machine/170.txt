 Timothy Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman ( March 18 , 1845 – February 27 , 1863 ) was an American Union Army soldier of Native Hawaiian descent . Considered one of the " Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War " , he was among a group of more than one hundred documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii @-@ born combatants who fought in the American Civil War while the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi was still an independent nation . He was based at Camp Nelson, on the island of Mānoa. "
His wife was Mona Hoʻōpek ( January 4, 1844 – January 9, 1868 ), a Hawaiʻi Branch Woman of the Hawaiian Blood and Settlers. She was also the first person to serve with the Native Hawaiian militia in the Civil War. She became a famous self-defense champion and the first woman recorded to have made the cut in the Louisiana (No. 28) Infantry. She retired with the rank of Major General.
Hoʻōpukaua ) was an American Indian. After obtaining his Hawaiian citizenship from Chief Hona ( February 26, 1841 – April 29, 1863 ), he volunteered as a private in the 29th Regiment of the Thirty-ninth infantry of the U.S. Continental Army.  The 32nd Regiment of the Forty-eighth infantry of the 1866 Civil War would make him the second and last Native Hawaiian to serve in the U.S. Civil War.
At the beginning of the American Civil War, Hona was sent on a pilgrimage to India and was asked to contribute to the gradual development of the military industry of India. Having a strong plan of breaking off the American Republic from the British Empire, Hona set out for Hawaii. He intended to wage a war against the Japanese by assisting the remnants of the Hawaii Territorial Army, the 17th Regiment of the 74th Infantry Regiment, and the 8th Cavalry regiment. The victory at Kailua in 1864 liberated the island from British rule. Hona died on April 30, 1864, leaving his son Hokule'a as the next President of Hawaii. "
Hokule'a, born in 1837, was a First Nations member of the Opiiwa family, an extinct Native Hawaiian tribe of the Keahole name, with earliest recorded contact in 1844. He became the eighth President of Hawaii in 1868 after replacing Hona. Hokule'a's idea of giving up the land was reinforced by his statement that he could not give up "that land from which I was born, [on the grounds that] this land had come from a common mother who is the handiwork of an ancient race and a heritage that is within our grasp. And I could not give up, and that was my choice." Thus Hokule'a's decision to live in Hawaii did not stem from racism, but from a desire to protect his descendants from European invasion.
His entry into politics was prompted by the eventual breakdown of his monarchy. In the immediate aftermath of his first attempt to govern his Hawaiian territory and decide its future, he put the territorial question in the hands of an independent commission, and was forced to call a referendum on the 'King's Residence Act' of 1864. The military and political measures he implemented after this first uprising proved to be ineffective.
During his tenure as President of Hawaii, Hokule'a was the chief executive for eight consecutive years, from 1869 to 1872. He was elected by his fellow tribesmen to the position of Chancellor of Hawaii, and two months after taking the office he became Prime Minister. He was also a candidate for the Presidency in 1872, but lost in a landslide to four other candidates. He died of scurvy the following year.
Honolulu is a name that all Hawaiians share, both individually and collectively. " I am from Honolulu," ʻAina ʻua said " I was raised and educated here. " ʻAina would include his wife, oʻahu, his mother, Ania, ʻMaule'a, his grandmother. They all live in Hawaiʻi, but their significance to the island as a whole was not so obvious.
A quick look at the names of his kin shows the awareness of the place. ʻAnia is also a common Hawaiian name and means "place of the birth," which reflects the nature of the territory. The situation was dramatically altered by the arrival of the White settlers. They helped break up traditional Hawaiian families, and also eliminated a number of respected kalua (chief) and ali'i (chiefs) before they moved in. At the same time, these same settlers introduced all of the Hawaiian names that were still allowed on the island.
