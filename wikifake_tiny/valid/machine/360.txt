 Delaware Route 261 ( DE 261 ) and Pennsylvania Route 261 ( PA 261 ) , also known as Foulk Road , is a 6 @.@ 88 @-@ mile ( 11 @.@ 07 km ) state highway running through Delaware and Pennsylvania . DE 261 runs 4 @.@ 62 miles ( 7 @.@ 44 km ) through New Castle County , Delaware from an interchange with U.S. Route 202 ( US 202 ) and DE 141 north of Interstate 95 ( I @-@ 95 ) near Fairfax , Delaware , a community north of Wilmington , northeast to the Pennsylvania state line . While it has just over 23 miles ( 39 km ) of single-lane highway markings, US Route 201 follows nearby US Route 24 or US Route 22, whose route is not marked. The US 202 highway has a single-lane main highway segment along its entire length that crosses the Delaware state line at a point located 3 miles east of the Pennsylvania state line. Each state highway in the county shares a single traffic lane, or "right of way," with the highway in the county (except Delaware Route 5, which shares a left-turn lane with US Route 202 in Delaware county), with a signal-controlled signal on the right of the traffic lane (going straight into traffic). Also the state and county pay no tolls or fees on either state highway. Delaware Route 261 is not another well-known highway by any stretch of the imagination. It was quite a long way from DC to DC (i.e. the route was 3 miles per hour) when it was chosen to serve the needs of the mail-loading convoys that transported letters to and from Washington, DC. This is the only thing that will really excite you about Route 261. While it is in fact the last major rural route to Washington, the long route is not in any way different from any other route on a US highway. On most high-volume roads, the visibility is significantly more, and several cars can be seen at any time. Additionally, a driver can rest in traffic or at a reduced speed. The speed limit is 50 miles per hour. Alongside the route and on the left are "U.S. Route 202" and "The Circle", the two main highways to and from Washington, DC that were designed by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) as speed limit curves on highways, routes, and segments between the states of Maryland and Virginia. They are essentially "wrong-side" state routes, except that the traffic is going straight on. They are in fact many sides of the road, but on some turns the right-most lane is left-of-way. This is the shortest, least traveled, and least traveled route in the entire country, except the bypass to York, PA ( that is also the least traveled route by most Americans). On the right are "US Route 202" and "The Circle", the two main highways to and from Washington, DC that were designed by NHTSA as speed limit curves on highways, routes, and segments between the states of Maryland and Virginia. They are essentially "wrong-side" state routes, except that the traffic is going straight on. They are in fact many sides of the road, but on some turns the right-most lane is left-of-way. This is the shortest, least traveled, and least traveled route in the entire country, except the bypass to York, PA ( that is also the least traveled route by most Americans). Delaware Route 261 is a real unique highway. However, many of the same locations and business interests are found on all the other "Pennsylvania" highways, which you should see below for a more detailed overview.
