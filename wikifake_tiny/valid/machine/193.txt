 The exploration of Jupiter has been conducted via close observations by automated spacecraft . It began with the arrival of Pioneer 10 into the Jovian system in 1973 , and , as of 2016 , has continued with eight further spacecraft missions . All of these missions were undertaken by the National <unk> and Space Administration ( NASA ) , and all but two have been flybys that take detailed observations without the probe landing or entering orbit .

However, within the last few years there have been a number of much larger probes that have discovered and mapped Jupiter's other bodies as well. One of the most ambitious of these was the <unk> Solar Probe <unke>. The <unk> concept is a series of trans-Jupiter probes that will explore the enormous innermost moon of Jupiter.  The Solar Probe <unk> was launched in 2004, and its main objective is to discover and measure  the degree of magnetic resonance in Jupiter's magnetic field. It will come within 2,700 miles of the equator of the moon, and its most recent measurement was done in September 2016. The actual descent to the surface will happen approximately 120 days later, in the Autumn of 2016.  The <unk> probe was to take a topographic image of the south polar region, so its impact was expected to yield information on how the magnetic field is spreading throughout the system. The result of this investigation has been summarized by Andrew Eberle, an astronomer and <unk> mission manager :  "  Although the Mission failed to report any magnetic field variations, the <unk> spacecraft had already performed some of the most important studies of its kind, directly mapping magnetic polar regions and measuring specific gravity. It is probably time now for the Earth's magnetic field to be turned on its head – and for scientists to use this opportunity to explore the new physics of the extreme environments beneath our planet."  The last time a planetary exploration mission discovered Jupiter's unique magnetic field was in 2003, when NASA's <unk> probe soared through the southern hemisphere of the giant planet. In April of that year, the probe followed up on the measurements made by the Solar Probe <unk>, visiting the most distant place it has ever gone. At this point, the Sun appears to be facing away from Jupiter.

This image (above) was received from the <unk> Mission Team in July 2016, and shows the Sun at 8 p.m. local (7 p.m. on July 7th) on its current position in the southern hemisphere of the Solar System, towards the outer solar system.  We can see the dimming of the Sun in the upper left, which is what is sometimes referred to as a solar "pump".
The solar illumination is now lowering, and will reach a very low state for the <unk> probe by 5 p.m. local on July 6th. From there, the Earth's magnetic field is expected to transform into a flexural one, and jolt the probe along a penumbral axis.  Until the Sun's position is corrected, the spacecraft will be locked into a static position, and will not be able to exit the Solar System. It is estimated that the probe will travel about 8 million miles from Earth, and reach Jupiter's innermost moon (which is 150 million miles away) on July 22nd, 2017.
