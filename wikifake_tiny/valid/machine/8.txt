Crimes and Fatalities

The highway is described as being in high-density drug-trafficking areas and very populated areas, to include other drug-trafficking areas in the region. Crime is most frequently related to drug trafficking, and in many of the areas, the impact is particularly severe. For example, approximately $450 million worth of cocaine is shipped from South America to North America annually. The highway has been identified as a major opportunity for crime in the area due to its proximity to several major traffickers of controlled substances. The FBI statistics show that New Jersey State Route 50 is the 5th most violent highway in the United States.
