Some Sunken Ships

These ships are not sunk, although they are not well known, and they have either been identified as having sunk or they are still in good condition. When visiting all the ships listed below, please note that to insure a safe navigation, you must have a full set of reference notes and tests from a qualified wrecker.

Novaille d'Assise : 15 ft 7.9 in (4.9 m)

: 15 ft 7.9 in (4.9 m) George Falconer: 24 ft (7.8 m)

Gubner II: 29 ft 6.8 in (8.8 m)

Albatross : 27 ft 4.3 in (8.1 m)

Luna Love: 28 ft 8.7 in (9.3 m)

Priora: 14 ft 11.4 in (3.1 m)

Priora is a huge, nearly 2-m-wide destroyer, taken from the Spanish Fleet in October of 1788. An unusual type of merchant ship, Priora was officially under the control of the British Navy, and is considered to be of Mexican origin. Built by Silvester and Fernández, it served in the Navy from 1789-1800, and although it was given French nationality in 1808, she was thought to be Spanish-owned. Nevertheless, a detailed inspection of her papers in 1832 revealed she had been taken from Spain and renamed Proria Del Lago, after the French states to which the wreck had been handed. After a brief service in the Navy, Priora was sold to the United States Navy. The ship was mostly preserved in the Yard of the San Francisco Fleet Yard, but was struck from its records in 1936. In 2010, Priora was recommissioned and re-activated, this time by the Treasure Department. In 2011, the vessel was awarded the H.M.S. Kidd's 1914 Refit Award. This ship is damaged and badly out of order, but its views are still remarkable. It was twice removed to Harvard University, during an expedition of the Queen Elizabeth's London vessel to inspect additional sonar sights. The SS Kidd was damaged in the course of the expedition. In 1959, another ship, SS Fenwick, was briefly set on fire, this time by a coal-thrower. The HMS Fenwick was decommissioned and sold to the European Development Fund in 1968. In 1986, she was joined by several other World War II European-flagged and -built merchant ships that have still been in use:
