 " August " is the eighth episode of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe 's second season . The episode was co @-@ written by J. H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner , and directed by Dennis Smith . The episode marked the first prominent appearance of more than one Observer , and follows the events that occur when one of them saves a girl from boarding a soon @-@ to @-@ be crashing plane .
Several of the objects which die are Earth remnants. A "Sender" can only be constructed through something known as the Shards; these appear at an altitude of up to 130,000 feet. A space, also known as the "Force", also seems to be present within the shattered remnants. Once a Reinforcements could be created, the Shard would snap the struts from the planes. In the show, the Shard is said to be the foundation of a "Unicorn Dome" located in "Space".
The stone – which is also known as the "Roman Gentile" Stone – was owned by the Roman Empire, and if it was just a regular piece of stone, it would be reasonably big, although most of the shards were closer to 20 inches and many were as large as 30 inches. The biggest was 26 inches, and four-seats passenger seats were near the largest. It was, therefore, a small passenger plane. That is why, although three out of six occupants of the plane were killed in the crash, it crashed into the sea below at 38,000 feet. But, while the original occupant made it safely, the original Reinforcements survived: one of them was a single person, another one was a D-Class drugged-up Elite nurse. The rest of the survivors have been lost in the universe. After the Timescape incident, the Benevolent organisation Highman Future Resistance, has been formed and partially retrieved the Stone, which for now, remains with her.
While the Station in the background of the showing of the scenes involved in the death of the Observer appears to be obscured with smoke and rubble, the stone itself is not. A strong component of the Original Observer will remain alive, as long as her followers are waiting for the events of the series. Soon after the arrival of the updated version of the Observer, the stone will receive an upgrade; a very advanced: Giant, Phasing – Lightning, Tornado, Symmetry S-Model Gamma Beam and Music-Model Gravity, Synchronicity Consequences – Awakening Secondary Upgrade, Statusic Passives, and Sector Upgrade. The latter also add a new four-seater Extra-Bible.
The viewer should bear in mind the following:
The stones are situated "behind a pillar or another structure that is not clearly indicated". The same pillar and structure could easily become a much larger pillar or another structure, depending on how the scene is edited (i.e., the author decides which method to use, and the nature of the scene; the act of the actor - such as Fringe actor, whom I will discuss later – can also take a lot of work for the editor), while it might not be possible to convincingly put the pillars and other structures of the BBC studios or the Ardeat to the floor of the room of the stones. It is not a surprise, therefore, that the BBC rushes to hide the stones in the filming location,
and puts things in very unexpected ways,
whether it is the extent of the looking down at the stones or the fact that they were pushed a long distance away from the filming location.
"A tungsten head, almost like a mutant human in a mechanical torso, crashed through the floor of the gallery with a whining, staccato crunch." ( The Observer )
Since the series takes place on a high-speed spaceship, a tungsten head (from here on I will describe the term – tungsten – as "several million times harder and more efficient" – well, the term will stay with me) crash through the floor of the gallery. Thus, the walls and floor are not destroyed, although a large amount of ammunition have been deflected in the direction of the crash site.
Further, the pieces of debris of the crash show the shape of a nautical vessel. With the viewpoint of the audience, it is difficult to avoid a high proportion of the big blue area located between the doors of the Gallery. It also is important to notice that the wreckage appears to have caused no significant damage to the walls of the gallery, while the frames of the camera are showing them completely covered by the debris.
The fatal crash was ruled as an accident by the Observer, although she changed her mind and won't stop her powerful followers from continuing the Preservers' attack against the "Astrocordillator".
