 Tropical Cyclone Herbie was the only known tropical system to impact Western Australia during the month of May on record . The final cyclone of the 1987 – 88 Australian region cyclone season , Herbie was first identified northwest of the <unk> Islands on 17 May . The following day , the system was classified as a tropical low by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and intensified into a Category 1 cyclone later that day . The ABC Meteorology homepage provides a synopsis of the system. Herbie was a well-characterized and predictable system. The severe circulation consisted of a trough oriented northwest to northeast between 20°S and 30°S and no close-in system was reported to have formed ( Figure 8 ). The circulation continued westward at 10-15km/h, with longwave troughs and deep ridges in the southeast and southwest ( Figure 9 ).

Mg intensity was moderate, with maximum values of 2.4 mm/hr near Lizard Head, and 2.2 mm/hr near West Island (Riddell) in the western part of Western Australia. Maximum and minimum pressure (6.0 and 6.4 mb, respectively) were observed along with several cyclones at. Pacific Ocean‐wide variations in precipitation and cloud cover were mostly uneventful ( Figures 3 and 4 ), and the season resulted in a slightly higher moisture content of the atmospheric boundary layer. The rainfall was considerable, with 18 months of rainfall in total in 1987 – 1988 compared with 17 in 1990. A number of islands and about 4,000 km² of low-lying coastal land were hit by the storm. The storm covered most of Western Australia ( Figures 7 and 8 ).

The cyclone event, for a possible up to 20 days, damaged a number of structures and agriculture [ 27, 28 ]. In Klamath County, the small, 37-hectare Nursery Farm of 24 sheep was extensively damaged, and a number of individuals were killed. However, this event resulted in little or no destruction of the stock, and was not reported in reports [ 29, 30 ]. However, the Inverness Road, a culvert that was part of the road system that carried the more than 2,500 persons to the plantations was badly damaged during the event, and structural damage was only reported by local residents. The City of Lakes, a 4.2 km long main artery along which the storm waters from the coastal Plain flowed into the communities of Riversdale, Miller Valley and Redfern during the event, was generally unaffected, but due to the way that the storm drains interweave their course, damage was not limited to this route, causing several to fail [ 31 ].

In 1987 – 1988, Herbie was the second largest cyclone in the Eastern Pacific region, with a maximum intensity of 12.0 on the Jet Stream/A wave indicator. Over the study period, Herbie reached a maximum of 14.5 on the Jet Stream/A wave indicator and a minimum of 12.9 on the Jet Stream/A wave indicator. However, a significant increase in annual occurrence during the period was observed for the three locations in Western Australia [ 24 ].

What is known about Herbie? Herbie was a storm originating in the tropical waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, the first cyclone to occur in this region since Cyclone WF 8 in 1964, and followed a normal tropical cyclone way of life over much of the northern Pacific region. The cyclone was associated with an increase in mid‐level extratropical cyclone intensity in the region [ 17 ], although the major impact was on northern Australia, about 20% of which was indirectly affected by the storm [ 18 ].

Results of the study: Tropical Cyclone Herbie 1987 – 1988:

Along the western Australian coast, a sequence of tropical cyclones developed during the winter of 1987 – 1988. The cyclones were subdivided into northern and southern portions. Of the four northern cyclones, two reached maximum tropical intensity and had extreme profiles, with maxima in the Jet Stream and the A wave. This followed a 6 – 7 day occurrence of mid‐level extratropical cyclone intensity. The other three cyclones extended westward into the central Australian continent, with maximum observed tropical intensities of 11.4 on 18 May, 20.8 on 25 May, and 20.3 on 29 May. The northern cyclones averaged about 7 – 10.6 km s −1 and had an average width of 10.4 km. The tropical cyclones developed along a coast that ran from the sea east of Lizard Head to about 10 km south‐west of Redfern in the northeast corner of Western Australia. Mean cyclone length ranged from 0.9 to 1.7 km and was estimated to be from 20.
