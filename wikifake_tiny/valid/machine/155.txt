 " Far Away Places " is the sixth episode of the fifth season of the American television drama series Mad Men and the <unk> episode of the series overall . It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner and writer <unk> <unk> , and directed by Scott <unk> . It originally aired on AMC in the United States on April 22 , 2012 . 
 The episode takes place almost entirely over a single day , telling three stories in a non @-@ linear narrative . Those stories are the Valentine's Day dance, a news story about a Dow-Jones in the city, and the Gold Rush of 1846. 
 Older Victor adheres to Mad Men's trend of only using certain episodes for their "first season" references. For example, on the February 9th episode, " The Cupcake," Don Draper says that he recently visited a bakery (and thus the first time since Season 1) to thank his friends for his wedding gift (a doughnut recipe) by mentioning the Desperate States of America. 
In this episode, the mostly familiar refrain of " I just need to grab one of those small days " is explicitly employed, thanks to two of the three stories just described being the large Days of Our Lives (the City, the Dow-Jones ), the rather uncommon Days of Our Lives (the " burbs," the Gold Rush ), and the idiom of the narrative being a one-day joke or bachelorette party. 
[SPOILERS: I will discuss the three dates later in the blog post.] 
[spoiler warning]
Day 0 : Sally Draper and Harold Draper attend their dear, dear Birkenstock wedding party in the comfort of the house (they don't attend the actual wedding, however, because of their marriage ). 
Day 2 : In the Chase dinner party, Don ("J. Robbins") (as part of a restatement of the push-bar hypothesis) plays possum in a car.
Day 5 : Three parts of the episode take place over the course of a day: Sally's dinner party with her mother (in the area where the Whippoorwill flowers are, or in the area where the local Henhouse and the prominent North Penn restaurant are, or in the area where the Land-Grant offices are), Don's lunch, and a comedy dinner. 
[spoiler warning]
- Don tries to get his gold bars on the morning of April 17, but his delivery of the gold bars to Marcello is delayed and he does not have enough time to contact Harold before the Day of the Whippoorwill flowers come down. 
- Wendy Bartley of the Quimby Group interrupts Don's romantic dinner with the Dean, causing him to misremember their date at the photographer.
- In Harold's school newspaper, he interviews Ben Crane, the former President of Hispano-American Oil Company.
- Since both Dow-Jones and land-grant offices are in Richmond, Virginia, it is clear that the prices for land in the region are relatively high. 
- In the Glamis Royale events, the players are discussing the problem of " job-hunting," the "Olympic Games," " Nixon's cat," and " war-on-drugs."

The African Exclusion Act had long been known as the " Hermit Rule." Both the Exclusion Act and the prohibition of African immigration to the United States were designed to keep the activities of these groups from damaging white cultural and economic interests. In 1882, the first African American drafted for the U.S. Army was forced to leave his family behind when he was taken prisoner by a band of Sioux on their reservations. The second black soldier drafted was wounded in action, but once he returned to the United States, he remained active in the black community and continued to serve with distinction. The third black draft was injured in combat, leaving him to wait and volunteer, before being shipped home by the War Department. Most citizens of that time were already worried about the end of slavery, and the cessation of war was clearly a popular issue. In 1942, the day after the end of the war, the color line was barely drawn in the matter of disarming African-Americans.   For example, In 1956, Mississippi Governor Calvin Coolidge signed into law an equal-rights law that defined for the first time African-Americans as a protected class. It defined "discrimination in employment" as an act that prohibited an employee from taking jobs based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or disability. In 1967, a unanimous Supreme Court overturned the Civil Rights Act of 1875, arguing that those protections, though inextricably linked, did not extend to the rights of employers to discriminate on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
