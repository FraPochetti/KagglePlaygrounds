 Andrew Johnston ( born 23 September 1994 ) is a British singer who rose to fame when he appeared as a boy soprano on the second series of the UK television talent show Britain 's Got Talent in 2008 . Although he did not win the competition , he received a contract to record with Syco Music , a label owned by the Britain 's Got Talent judge Simon Cowell . Johnston 's debut album , One Voice , was released in September of the same year , and reached number four on the UK Albums Chart . As of June 2011, he has released five singles, which have all reached number one on the UK Independent Singles Chart. On 2 August 2011, the Glastonbury Festival said that the previous high of two million people in attendance for the festival's first night in 2008 would not be repeated.
Following Glastonbury, the socialite had an immense amount of press. The first article was written in the website The Independent, where Johnston was asked to name his favorite musicians. He said, " I'm not sure how that was possible. I really couldn't think of anything – it has got to be something brilliant. Everyone is very inspirational and I'm not embarrassed to have gone on stage. So, after that, I felt extremely busy at the music festival and it was busy and it was busy and it was busy. I think we all got over-stimulated by the high level of aggression and the excesses. For example, it was just just a dust-up and a bit of a bad omen, and for a lot of people they just didn't want to hear it. People wanted to go to the next gig and there was another gig, and there was another gig and there was another and they were playing very loud and everything. It was just rubbish – we had to turn down the volume, I had to put it down to a very low level. Then we went home and thought about it again – this time I just went home – I thought, well it was just nonsense, so why bother saying it again? ", [29] In May 2011, the musician was involved in a heated interview with James Corden, in which he denounced the "indecisive manner" of Britain's Got Talent, in a fashion that would probably have made Paula Abdul blush, and accused the judges of a "total disinterest in music and there was a complete disregard for it, by putting any song on the bill that they felt was not well-received", when it appeared that Star Wars'fan favourite Darth Vader had won the competition. It was reported that Corden, after receiving such a storm of abuse for suggesting "a form of perpetual bitch treatment" was the competition winner, said, "I'm never going to do that again, because, how could you?"

Andrew Johnston once wrote to New York Times critic David Carr, in which he said, "People are always telling me how important the role of celebrity is and I'm not sure whether it's not quite that important to this generation because it's grown up, but of course, it still is – and the fact that, of all the people in the world, it was never true was why I thought it was wonderful – that this was their moment. Of course I want people to enjoy themselves, but that is rarely the end result. I think it's interesting, anyway, to wonder: does being a celebrity make you more or less comfortable with who you are? I guess, if people want to ask me this, I think that's a good thing. Maybe a revolution in attitudes would be a good thing too?" [30]
On the 30th July 2013, President Obama announced he had appointed Andrew Johnston to the White House staff, stating: "Andrew is a champion of the working class, and one of my first acts as president will be to name Andrew to his Council of Economic Advisers. Andrew has put his name forward for this prestigious post because he has a lifelong devotion to the American Dream and the American way of life, and he will bring his experience as a producer, businessman, and entrepreneur to bear on our economic recovery and rebuilding effort. Andrew understands the role our economy must play to put more Americans back to work and get Americans back to work. Andrew will represent all Americans in this vital role, and as the first American to hold the title, he is an outstanding choice to help us in our mission to expand opportunity for all."
Johnson went on to say: "You can bet that the chair that I'm going to sit on is going to be in one of the Democratic or Republican chairs, and it's going to be the chair with the most conservative views of the lawmakers. That's how I think it should be.
