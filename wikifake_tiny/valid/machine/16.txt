 
 = M @-@ 82 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 
 M @-@ 82 is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula in the US state of Michigan that travels between <unk> and Howard City . The section between <unk> and Howard City travels through <unk> and along the southern edge of <unk> National Forest . The current version of M @-@ 82 is actually the second in the state ; the first usage appeared in the Upper Peninsula by 1919 . In 1927, when the National Forest of Howard City was finally established in the later part of the 1920s, the American Railway Association registered it and assigned it the number 6224, citing it as a trunk line.   It has been used to carry logging equipment into the forest from an adjacent area in the area to this day.
Here's a map of the remainder of the forest's territory that was designated as a National Park in 1985. M @-@ 82 was finally closed in 1986, and the area shown is the closed part of the woods. In 1984, the Interior Department started a survey that should have involved excavating, or covering up, some of the bits of discarded wood before they could be used to build a new bridge. Instead, they built a new bridge that splits the woods between two equally parallel angles:  M @-@ 83.  In 2001, the whole forest was cordoned off and destroyed by the "cold war" weapons program in Iraq.
Now we find the rest of the old forest:
It's a large forest, but the most obvious is that it's long since flattened.
Here's a closer view.  It's north-south oriented, meaning that it takes you down into the forest from the north, which makes sense for a highway to go along. There is a slight curve at the north end.
Here's an overhead view.
 The whole project was actually funded by the Federal Highway Administration's proposed $35 million overpass that would have covered a 160-mile stretch of federal highway from the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania to Malvern, West Virginia.    It was eventually scrapped, but as we can see here, the section had been designated as a National Park in 1987.
But this section in the middle of the forest doesn't look like much of a road. It can only be driven down a single lane. It takes a little training to get the hang of it. On the way in from the parking lot, there's a soft dirt shoulder that's slippery to drive on, but not to speed. After just about an hour and a half of driving, we ended up in the middle of the forest. What a relief!
Here's the visitor center. The area here on the right is where the travel area is set up for a loop to the parking lot. On the far left, you can see where we came in on the way in.
Here's the hiker's center, which consists of benches and some restrooms.
The last thing we had to do was pick up some of the mail. One thing that the locals know about is that Northern Michigan's mail gets wrapped up and carried up and down M-2A on the western side of the highway in a big wooden tub of wooden tubing (some the length of a decent sized boat or jeep). 
This bike seems pretty ancient. The bikes have all been replaced with the newer ones.
The sleeping-box is long gone and is now replaced with a bench.
