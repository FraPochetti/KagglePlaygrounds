Below are the facts about the tower, built by Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in 1906 (recalling that the North Tower was actually built in 1907 as a Naval Observatory). We have included historical photos and sketches of the building, its construction and operations (both by the San Francisco Public Library, the Arno Library, and the San Francisco Art Institute ).


The building was built in a stunning fashion by G.K. Harris of the GK Harris Architectural & Environmental Division. Built to original designs, in full view of the rising San Francisco skyline and Golden Gate Bridge, the tower has 5 stories at 108 feet and an additional 3 stories on the 2nd to 5th floors at 102 feet. Designed in a 1,400 ton steel frame, the tower's design was to use as few exterior walls as possible to emphasize the eye-catching roofline, encourage orientation of the building over the surrounding buildings, and prevent gusts of wind and ocean waves from hitting the observation deck or balconies. The building houses 272 apartments, and the below are a partial listing of the tower's listing windows, along with a partial listing of the building's storage units ( room a1 to a2 ).

Although the skyscraper is technically completed, there are still many waiting to get inside its atrium, and many have been in for months (some even years). When the tower is opened, approximately 1,000 people will take their first step inside. Each floor of the building has 18 stories. The first floor houses two floor plates, with rooms a1-a4 numbered 1-a4, and room a6 numbered 6-a6, each numbered 8-a8. These are the main floors with studios, rec rooms, and additional apartments on the higher floors. Each apartment on the upper levels has an uncluttered walkway for visitors to enjoy a panoramic view of the city. Each of the upper floors have 360ยบ panoramic views. To visit the building, take the Golden Gate Bridge east of the Ferry Building (about 3 blocks east of the building), and then go east. You should take the north exit. Pass under the cable cars at Golden Gate Park, then head east on King Street for about 1 block, and you'll see the building. On the way home you'll see the Ferry Building in the distance. From the structure you will be looking at the city and the Golden Gate Bridge (see the location map ). As you drive to the atrium, drive up King Street from one of the north end of King Street, and you'll see the tower.
