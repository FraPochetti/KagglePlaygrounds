 The Lady in the Lake trial was a 2005 murder case in which Gordon Park ( 25 January 1944 – 25 January 2010 ) a retired teacher from <unk> , near Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness , Cumbria , England , was jailed for life for the murder of his first wife , Carol Ann Park , in 1976 . 
 Carol Park went missing on 17 July 1976 , and was never seen alive again by her family . In 1997 , her body was discovered by divers in Coniston Water and Gordon was arrested on suspicion of murder . He pleaded guilty and received a minimum of 25 years imprisonment. His next judicial review  was launched after his conviction. 
This new case, began  on 7 December, was started by Gordon on the basis of his first judicial review in 2012  on the grounds that there was 'a very strong case for him to be on a public interest defence and his behaviour at his trial was indicative of him being a serious offender'.
However, on 20 January 2013, the Court of Appeal in Kingborough said that if convicted, he should face a retrial. 
For this reason and on the basis of evidence, which the prosecution had not presented, the Crown accepted that the case should be re-examined.
Gordon's legal team had argued that the Crown should exclude from evidence the confession of someone outside his immediate family, who had signed a voluntary statement before trial. The jury was not told this, and so a new trial would not have been possible. This argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal and, having rejected the Crown's submissions, the trial took place.
The following documents were submitted for disclosure to the Crown:
(1) The unclassified executive summary of the appeals judgment of Lord Hoffmann (1 May 2001) (all three appeals) (High Court of Appeal ), a copy of which was obtained from the Crown by the person responsible for producing it. (2) The second original document, marked confidential by the Crown, signed by the first police officer who interviewed Gordon. 
1) Michael O'Riordan, Maud Jenkins, Russell Nelson and Colin Jessop, The Women's File - Conviction of Gordon Park (Oxfordshire: Bodley Head, 2011) p 21
2) The declassified version of this document. I am not a specialist in this subject and would be grateful if any experts could please correct me. 
3) Second original document, signed by the first officer.
4) An extract from the actual trial transcript. 
Gordon argues that the third original document is very serious evidence which should be suppressed. The Crown responds that he should only be punished if his first confession was produced to the Crown. 
Gordon argues that the first officer who spoke to him, said that it was a flat lie and that he wanted to get rid of the DNA evidence. The Crown says that this means that he was unlikely to make further statements to police or to answer further questions. The Third original document shows that Gordon asked the officer how much DNA he would have to take. 
The Crown notes that, following a thorough investigation, the officers found a number of things in his home that did not follow their initial investigations. 
Gordon argues that the Crown should rule that he was only asked how he wanted to get rid of his DNA evidence and that any further questions to him were recorded in the system. 
While he is appealing the case, Mr. Gordon is appealing the decision of the Supreme Court in the Gordon Park & Jennifer Shipton -prisoner-exclusion cases (BBC v Bulworth 2009-1336) ( Sqn no 3 - Chief Justice of the UK Supreme Court ) (September 8 2013).
