 The Gloire @-@ class ships were designed as enlarged and improved versions of the <unk> @-@ class armored cruisers by Emile Bertin . This class has more rugged hull, and heavier armament than the <unk> class, but was considered superior in terms of maneuverability and cargo capacity. 
 
The French cruiser " St. Joseph " (name taken from Saint Joseph of Arc by Gerard de Sully ) was the first of the 8 ~ 9 m class ; she was launched in 1922 and replaced the "Ernesto" class cruiser. It was built for the French Navy, and it used modified experimental British components. According to the hull, " St. Joseph " was described by Bertin as " wihout the lesser breechwork the hull was already built from timber, with a shallow draft. The magazines were fully propelled, but mainly percussion. The missiles were about twice as long as the British "fish hooks", which were fixed at both ends of the gun. In any event, the 664 tons of burthen are estimated to be sufficient to support the squadrons' complement of five fighters. However, it is difficult to imagine a large caliber machine gun firing in the fight from a 15.5-millimeter barrel, and the astute observer would discover that to only one degree off from horizontal angle. In any case, the minor foresail is not equipped with iron ball, but with a steel hook  leaving no space for a trigger. The gun was only about four feet in diameter. The gun has a main gun tube having 4.5 feet in diameter and a 5.0 ft barrel. The hull and engine were a compromise between a "machine-gun" and the "marine-gun" that was used on amphibious warships. As one can see, the hydraulic torsion bars are 20 centimeters in diameter. About 22,000 troops were carried aboard this strange ship. But even more disturbing is that this ship is really an armored cruiser! And they didn't finish the weapon, with the maximum range of the 8m class from eight miles to nearly 20 miles. It is quite clear that " St. Joseph " as well as other "Cavalry" cruisers could not be fully armed for a war. The lightest armor consists of light grilles on the sides, and top side armor that is made of a special steel that melts at 600°C.
ST. JOSEPH (1922) in her store room of The INS (1922) was only able to accommodate 1000 men. This is because she uses significantly larger caliber calibers than other French class cruisers. The ship is at the end of its life expectancy and not scheduled for restoration.
