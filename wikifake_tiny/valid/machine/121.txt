 The Crab with the Golden Claws ( French : Le <unk> aux <unk> d <unk> ) is the ninth volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . The story was serialised weekly in Le Soir Jeunesse , the children 's supplement to Le Soir , Belgium 's leading francophone newspaper , from October 1940 to October 1941 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II . The comic took its name from Tintin's place of origin, the wealthy "House of Cuvier" in Charleville-Mézières.
[ 53 ] [ 54 ] The French comic was an unusual choice for a war comic. For one thing, most war comics dealt with the military situation, while this comic dealt with political events, making it unlike most war comics. After the war, the story came back and published twice weekly, and eventually it was completely re-reprinted in four volumes. In addition, there were a number of translation stories that took over the earlier adventures of Tintin.The French comic was an unusual choice for a war comic.

[ 55 ] Many Belgian bookstores did not have access to new comics until the seventies, because they believed that they were too childish to be read. One thing that did happen, however, was that the characters of the comic were formed, based on real family members, with appearances in cartoons from August 1945 to January 1946, as part of Belgium's liberation. Many Belgians would likely have benefited from reading the comic, having become more used to the colours and more interested in French things.
[ 56 ] By the end of the war, the French comics had only succeeded in creating interest in Belgium, although the cartoonist was still considered both problematic and distasteful by his countrymen. At one point, shortly after the battle of Le Magnifique, the CIA decided to mail cartoons of the children's hero to European countries, with the basic message: if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. [ 57 ] Tintin continued to do well in the United States, but at one point, his popularity spread beyond the borders of Belgium and Holland and reached the United States. In 1960, William Harcourt started publishing a French-language English translation of Tintin's adventures.By the end of the war, the French comics had only succeeded in creating interest in, although the cartoonist was still considered both problematic and distasteful by his countrymen.

 [ 59 ] In 1990, he was brought back to the pages of comic book form by Virgin Publishing in an animated feature called (in French) Tintin : Le bol — the crab with the golden claws — which replaced the comic's British name of " Le Dernier Stern " as the name of the comic that replaced the series in 1950. In a similar fashion to the American cartoon, Tintin was renamed " Le hors d'or."
[ 60 ] An animated English remake of Tintin was released in 1994 under the title Tintin in France, taking Tintin's life across the Channel. Written and directed by Bernie Wrightson, the film featured an extensive cast and includes a game of pick-up football, a gourmet French chef and a French flatmate.
French and Swedish translations [ edit ]
[ 62 ] These are the first French and Swedish translations of Tintin, in his two languages. The French and Swedish editions of Tintin were illustrated by Abdoulie Manjean - a first for the Dutchmen - with notes from the French and Swedish editors by François Waguen. The first German, Italian, Italian-Spanish, Norwegian and Dutch versions were published by De-Me Inc., a division of the Dutch publisher Peter de Meck. The French and Swedish editions were collected in two volumes in 1962 under the name Tintin.
