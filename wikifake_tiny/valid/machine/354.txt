 
 = Etymology of Wicca = 
 
 In Modern English , the term Wicca ( / <unk> / ) refers to Wicca , the religion of contemporary Pagan Witchcraft . It is used within the Pagan community under competing definitions . One refers to the entirety of the Pagan Witchcraft movement , while the other refers explicitly to traditions included in what is now called British Traditional Wicca . 
 Although pronounced differently , Wicca is related to the Old English word wicca , which referred to <unk> in Anglo @-@ Saxon England . This theory suggests that Wicca has been a result of continuing Medieval English Wicca and somehow coalesced to become the equivalent of "modern" Wicca.
Even if the "modern" Wicca is a result of traditional Wicca, is it any more-or-less-derived from the "worse" (i.e. older) form of Wicca? I would guess that it would be closer to the original language of Middle English and Norse than to Medieval English. Which is not to say that Middle English (known as Old English) had to begin with Old Norse, but that Norse was the dominant language at the time of Old English. 
There are a few signs in Middle English, especially in prose and poetry, that it likely came out of Old Norse. To get around these problems, I've gone through all the literature of Middle English (from Old English to Old English Carolingian period and beyond) and I have found an obvious pattern. But the pattern is much smaller than the one proposed by the above theory. 
Before I set out to try to interpret Middle English, let me first highlight one big, glaring, and ahistorical problem with most commentators' thinking on Middle English. It isn't that the MEG was derived from a "worse" proto-MEG. In fact, the only hint of this emerges in certain later works. So the lack of attestation, even of the most primitive "worse" forms, is a problem. However, it is not a problem that is unique to Middle English. There are many more obvious problems with the different terminology used in the English language. Let me briefly identify them:
1. Pronunciation -- some voices might be a little disconcerted to hear me praise someone for pronouncing "wes" with the /x/ sound, but the vowel sounds (A, E, I, J) are more pronounced in Middle English, so how can I argue that the "worse" proto-MEG of wicca somehow evolved to take over with a low-pitched consonant sounds (as suggested by the reduplicated forms)? I'm reminded of the "Proto-Germanic" spirit of famous works such as Gen 1-3 of Du Bohn von Metz, which was first published in German in 1539 and then translated into English in 1611 (the English editions were translated from Latin, as we can see). The German language really is, to put it bluntly, "noisy" when it comes to pronouncing the "L" sounds. There is also a distinctive "v" sound in Old English, probably present in the proto-MEG itself, or something closer. I've heard people say that a 5th-century "bomme" of German origin like "menhor" changed to "nathan", which I've read as meaning "naughty" in medieval English, which is a pretty curious theory. There is at least one known case of "magna Germania" in the 13th century, but that isn't relevant here. It is also just as easy to explain why the name "Wicca" becomes popular in the pre-Christian era: the Old English and Middle English speakers wanted to get rid of an English-derived "nuisance" and created a new name for themselves.
2. Speech. A major fault with the great majority of biblical scholars is their inability to admit that the Bible has no definite structure, and therefore is often, even in the first part of the Bible, ambiguous. For example, on p. 82, I first heard the following argument: "Then the Lord spake, and said, 'This shall be a sign to you: You shall wear the sign of the living God in your hands. Then you shall fast forty days and forty nights for the Lord. And you shall learn to keep his commandments and his statutes. And the days that you fast for the Lord, you shall eat only unleavened bread on the fourth day, and it shall be your law. And you shall proclaim his name throughout all your land, and his name shall be in your heart. You shall keep his praises in your mouth and your tongue.
