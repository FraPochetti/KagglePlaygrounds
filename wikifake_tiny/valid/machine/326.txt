 The 2 / 4th Machine Gun Battalion was an Australian Army unit raised for service with the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) during the Second World War . Formed in late 1940 as part of the 8th Division , the battalion was established to provide direct fire support to the division ’ s infantry brigades . It was the fourth , and last , such unit raised within the 2nd AIF . The Battalion was responsible for direct fire support during the initial months of the fighting in the Reich and in the Pacific. This included the marshalling of British, American and Australian armaments for what became known as Operation Vizsla. The Battalion featured a 9.7 cm and 8.5 cm gun armed with either 500 or 3000 rounds of M1 F1 ammunition. On 24 June 1942, the battalion's 3rd Squadron, Royal Australian Artillery, was transferred to South West Pacific Area to replace the 4th Squadron of the Australian Mechanised Infantry, which had been detached from the division to participate in Operation Vizsla.
The battalion's capabilities were assessed by Lt Col (later Brigadier General) Michael Woodhouse during his cross-sectional investigation in August 1942, when a team of "computer men" assessed the battalion's complement in its one month operational period with the division. The review stated that the company could not reasonably undertake missions against the Japanese with the available units, so the company was substituted for the division's artillery, with the battalion serving as the supporting elements. The battalion was formally detached from the 2nd AIF on 29 August.
The Battalion was attached to the 2nd AIF until it was transferred to the 76th Division for the next two months of the war. After the division had suffered extensive losses to aircraft during the final days of the Second World War, the 86th Division contacted the battalion about an option to join the Division to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union, to find a way to participate in the invasion. The battalion was made available to the 85th Division, which then requested that the battalion become attached to the division. On 12 August 1942, the Battalion was moved to the 86th Division to form the third battalion of the 86th Division. The 85th Division instructed the battalion to move to Turkey and wait for further orders from the division as to where it would deploy. The Battalion and its remaining units (the support company and some artillery elements) were made ready for deployment on 16 August 1942 at Ardougne, near the city of Omarsk in the Caucasus. The battalion would deploy to the Soviet Union within weeks, and find its way across the Russian front without too much concern for the weather. The battalion was attached to the 40th Division until it was transferred to the 66th Division on 6 December 1942. A battalion for the Waffen SS was established by the German High Command, on 24 January 1943. The 91st Division attached the 91st Battalion in May. Other war medals of significance:
