Otra Nota ( English : Another Note ) is a multi-platinum album, featuring one of the greatest salsa singers in history. An accomplished artist, Marc Anthony has dominated the Billboard Latin charts with his songwriting and voice. He rose to fame during the 1980s in Mexico and as well as to international fame in the 1990s, gaining popularity in Latin America. The title track and "In Your Heart" made him the very first person to have multiple number one records in different Latin American countries.  Marc Anthony started his career as a freestyle musician. Throughout the 1980s, he released many successful records for RMM Records. However, in 1988, he discovered the great songwriter and producer Carlos Santana, whom he worked with to make his debut album (Rough Love/Marc Anthony). In 1990, he was signed by RMM Records to sing and record another single, "Anglo," in salsa music. It was the first dance song he recorded with the help of Carlos Santana. In 1991, the same year, he released his second album in Latin America, Otra Nota (Spanish: Another Note), which brought him national recognition. Many of the songs he sang with Santana during this period were different than the original ones he had recorded with Santana in the late 1970s and early 1980s. (The result, depending on your perspective, is either Maronissance or Modern Renaissance.) Marc Anthony followed up his debut album with a hit in 1992, the Spanish-language Number One Artist song "Hay Vía En Señor". In 1993, his "Rey Marrano" came out in the Spanish-language album "Marc Anthony Quartet". The album includes remixes of three of his songs. A fan favorite, "La Conocimiento," is the last single on the album.

"La Conocimiento" and "Rey Marrano" are the most popular of his international hits.  La Conocimiento ( English : Another Note ) contains the original lyrics to Marc Anthony's "Cuerpo", and "Mija" is an explicit reference to a "Madonna of Mexico", Felipe Garcia.

The majority of the song's sales were in the U.S. Most notably, Marc Anthony's "Madonna of Mexico" was licensed by Live Nation as the soundtrack for the third season of the hit reality television show "American Idol."
