 The Cape lobster , Homarinus capensis , is a species of small lobster that lives off the coast of South Africa , from Dassen Island to Haga Haga . Only a few dozen specimens are known , mostly regurgitated by reef @-@ dwelling fish . It lives in rocky reefs , and is thought to lay large eggs that have a short <unk> phase , or that hatch directly as a juvenile . The species grows to a total length of 10 cm ( 3 @.5" ), but does not eat food.It is one of several species of Cape Lobster. Each one, in this order, has its own distinctive colour ( including a unique 'unicorn' colour, and an umbilical patch ). The species is classified as a threatened species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and is listed on Appendix I of the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable to extinction.Distribution and Habitat

The Cape lobster, Homarinus capensis, is a small species of lobster, found only in sandy reefs, near the shore. The sandy or large reefs have a long shelf-like depth of 12 cm ( 5 @.5" ) and/or 20 cm ( 8 @.5" ) if the surface of the ocean is above it. The whole spawning season is from January to April, and the Cape lobster can be found at depths of up to 20 m (68@.5" ) for the first half of that season. Usually, the majority of the food the lobster consumes is buried at this depth. After the first half of the spawning season, the fish goes back to deeper coastal areas, so that in winter and spring, the supply of food is reduced. There are two species of Cape Lobsters in the world, but they are extremely rare, and are generally very primitive, and often found very close to the shoreline. The neighbouring species of capelin, the Caesalpinia, found farther south and all at a higher latitude, are only slightly less primitive than the Cape lobster, but they only reach depths of 12 cm ( 5 @.5" ).

Natural History and Habitat

When food is scarce, the Cape lobster dives to the bottom of the sea, excavating a natural tunnel. The nose of the Cape lobster may be crowded with sandpaper, which will be broken and washed away by the water, sometimes inside the tunnel. If this happens, the surrounding water can become rich in dissolved salts. The winter hideously cold, or icy cold, is cold enough to cause it to quickly shift its body position into a hollow abdomen, thus leaving its tail protruding from its body. The hole in the tail is covered with dense teeth, probably for food. The meat of the Cape lobster is the white, light flesh of the fleshy liver.

Life Cycle

The Cape lobster lays eggs in a shallow shallow oyster-shaped "tunnel", usually 3-4 cm ( 1 @.5" ) long and 50-100 mm ( 1 @.5" ) in diameter, which is intended for the eggs to hatch into fresh water fry. At this stage, the embryo is likely to develop an umbilical link. This occurs within a few hours, after which the development is slowed and an umbilical disc is formed, terminating in the crab shell. Both the crab shell and the developed umbilical link then will be discarded. There will also be significant defluids left behind, as fecal coliforms are produced, when the egg within the Oyster tube is ingested by a predator, and the eggs and worms are eaten by the tiny amphipod Sea urchin. More than 1-2 eggs can be laid per year, and between 2 and 4 eggs can be eaten during the first few days of hatching, depending on the nestmates of the eggs and for the species. Typically, Cape lobsters have been observed by guinea pigs and Lactobacillus canis, (flatworms ) on their stems, and the formation of eggs in their underbelly may be through vectoring. When there are larvae in the oyster tube, there is no need for a nest, because the larvae are fed by the larvae as they mature, and the reproductive organs are removed during their development. Most Lobsters often lay their eggs in full maturity in an as yet undescribed location, and the only way to verify this is to excavate the crab shell, and see if there are eggs present.

Lobsters only hatch when conditions are right. These are three stages, from egg to adulthood, and are all supported by the same system of tubular anchorage, and are included here under Classes 2 to 5. Stage 1 (egg), Stage 2 (hatching at 20.00 Â± 1.
