It is situated atop the former Aztec sacred precinct near the <unk> Mayor on the northern side of the Plaza de la <unk> in Downtown Mexico City .
Climb up the giant cathedral tower at your leisure and take a tour and view from the ornate staircases as the parish is filled with countless apparitions and images of holy persons of the Roman Catholic Faith. This unique religious center houses a collection of 7500 beautifully lit antique crowns and 13000 relics, three of which have a profound historical significance. The collection is out of date and overflowing, however the rest of the cathedral is always well-polished and well-preserved.
The cathedral and the surrounding area was recently named "Best Place to Visit In Mexico" by Travel TV.
The Aztec Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception and Mission of Our Lady of Guadalupe is a prominent Aztec cathedral in Mexico City.
You might recall that the City of Red Walls built for the mummies at Teotihuacan is called Teotihuacán, a peculiar Mexican word meaning "Red Walls" (  that sounds like it should be some kind of a pun ). In 1517 the City of Mexico was besieged and the Aztec population were successfully "undertaken" by the Mexicans. Those nine Aztec lord of the Red Walls were captured and brutally tortured by burning the bodies, setting fire to the houses and torturing the captives. Most of the captives were executed and they were cut into pieces of meat, cooked, eaten and then "wrapped" in earth.  On December 21, 1523, the captives of the Red Walls were again slaughtered and on that day they were proclaimed to be the people of "We Can't Get Lost" (  On Dec. 21, the Aztecs were forced to gather and await their King's arrival to punish them for their atrocities against the Aztecs.  For more details check out "Aztec Conquests and Conquests Before Columbus" by Carla Bowman;  I was in the Aztec Empire for about 8 years.)
After the first 8 years of war the Spanish reached the capital of Aztec-Yucatan, the city itself was razed to the ground and rebuilt on the remains of the ruins of Teotihuacan. In 1506 the Spaniards, along with 12 new-born sons, conquered Teotihuacan and when they arrived in 1517 they ordered the destruction of the entire Teotihuacan culture and people. This announcement shocked the Aztec people who still fought back against the Spanish until the last slave cacti in the city were pushed down into the earth and planted with maize. At that time the entire Teotihuacan culture was wiped out.  The Lizards with 16 Ears, According to legend a group of copper aliens  who had studied human culture and their language for thousands of years, came to Earth. They came in a ship  , at the same time our human civilization   started. To live amongst the aliens they began creating crafts with metal and worked with the earth as tools and supports for their creation.
