 US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) is a component of the United States <unk> Highway System that connects Everett , Washington , to the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan , with a separate segment that runs from <unk> Point , New York , to <unk> , Maine . In Michigan , the highway runs through the UP in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering the state at <unk> and ending at St. Joseph, Michigan, about 80 miles northwest of Lansing, Michigan. The longest segment, 4 miles (6 km ) of on-ramp to US Highway 2 is part of the GO Transit GO Transit Corridor (GO Transit), a major integrated transit transit system. For a review of the GO Transit GO Transit Corridor section, see our report on GO Transit GO Transit. Additionally, there is a marked US 2 collector road (formerly named State Route 98) that provides access to the GO Transit GO Transit routes that cover portions of Michigan from Lansing to Buffalo, New York and of course provides access to the State Route 99 collector road that connects Portland to the city of Buffalo, New York. For more information about US 2 in Michigan and its links to other US roads and transit systems, see the Department of Transportation's detailed presentation for this stretch of road and its US 2 link.
